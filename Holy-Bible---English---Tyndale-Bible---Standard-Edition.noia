001	GEN	002	006	But there arose a myste out of the ground and watered all the face of the erth:
001	GEN	002	007	Then the LORde God shope man even of the moulde of the erth and brethed into his face the breth of lyfe.  So man was made a lyvynge soule.

001	GEN	002	018	And the LORde God sayd: it is not good that man shulde be alone I will make hym an helper to beare him company:
001	GEN	002	019	And after yt the LORde God had make of the erth all maner beastes of the felde and all maner foules of the ayre he brought them vnto Adam to see what he wold call them.  And as Ada called all maner livynge beastes: eve so are their names.

040	MAT	002	007	Then Herod prevely called the wyse men and dyligetly enquyred of them ye tyme of the starre that appered
040	MAT	002	008	and sent the to Bethleem saynge: Goo and searche dyligetly for ye chylde.  And when ye have founde hym bringe me worde yt I maye come and worshippe hym also.
040	MAT	002	009	When they had heard the kynge they departed: and lo the starre which they sawe in ye eeste went before them tyll it came and stode over the place where the chylde was.
040	MAT	002	010	When they sawe the starre they were marvelously glad:
040	MAT	002	011	and went into the house and found the chylde with Mary hys mother and kneled doune and worshipped hym and opened their treasures and offred vnto hym gyftes gold frackynsence and myrre.
040	MAT	002	012	And after they were warned of God in a dreame that they shuld not go ageyne to Herod they retourned into their awne countre another waye.
040	MAT	002	013	When they were departed: beholde the angell of the Lorde appered to Ioseph in dreame sayinge: aryse and take the chylde and his mother and flye into Egypte and abyde there tyll I brynge the worde.  For Herod will seke the chylde to destroye hym.
040	MAT	002	014	The he arose and toke the chylde and his mother by night and departed into Egypte
040	MAT	002	015	and was there vnto ye deeth of Herod to fulfill that which was spoken of the Lorde by ye Prophet which sayeth out of Egypte haue I called my sonne.
040	MAT	002	016	Then Herod perceavynge yt he was moocked of the wyse men was excedynge wroth and sent forth and slue all the chyldren that were in Bethleem and in all the costes there of as many as were two yere olde and vnder accordynge to the tyme which he had diligetly searched oute of the wyse men.
040	MAT	002	017	Then was fulfilled yt which was spoken by the Prophet Ieremy sayinge:
040	MAT	002	018	On the hilles was a voyce herde mornynge wepynge and greate lamentacion: Rachel wepynge for her chyldren and wolde not be conforted because they were not.
040	MAT	002	019	When Herode was deed: beholde an angell of ye Lorde appered in a dreame to Ioseph in Egypte
040	MAT	002	020	sayinge: arise and take ye chylde and his mother and go into ye londe of Israel.  For they are deed which sought ye chyldes life.
040	MAT	002	021	The he arose vp and toke ye chylde and his mother and cam into the londe of Israhel.
040	MAT	002	022	But whe he hearde yt Archelaus did raygne in Iury in ye roume of his father Herode he was afrayde to goo thither.  Not withstondynge after he was warned of god in a dreame he turned a syde into ye parties of Galile
040	MAT	002	023	and wet and dwelt in a cite called Nazareth to fulfill yt which was spoken by ye Prophetes: he shalbe called a Nazarite
040	MAT	003	001	In those dayes Ihon the Baptyst came and preached in the wildernes of Iury
040	MAT	003	002	saynge; Repet the kyngdome of heue is at honde.
040	MAT	003	003	This is he of whom it is spoken by the Prophet Esay which sayeth: The voyce of a cryer in wyldernes prepare the Lordes waye and make hys pathes strayght.
040	MAT	003	004	This Iho had hys garmet of camels heer and a gerdell of a skynne aboute his loynes.  Hys meate was locustes and wylde hony.
040	MAT	003	005	The went oute to hym Ierusalem and all Iury and all ye regio roude aboute Iorda
040	MAT	003	006	and were baptised of him in Iorda cofessynge their synnes.
040	MAT	003	007	When he sawe many of ye Pharises and of ye Saduces come to hys baptim he sayde vnto the: O generacio of vipers who hath taught you to fle fro the vengeauce to come?
040	MAT	003	008	Brynge forth therfore the frutes belongynge to repentauce.
040	MAT	003	009	And se that ye ons thynke not to saye in your selues we haue Abraham to oure father.  For I saye vnto you that God is able of these stones to rayse vp chyldern vnto Abraha.
040	MAT	003	010	Euenowe is ye axe put vnto ye rote of ye trees: soo that every tree which bringeth not forthe goode frute is hewe doune and cast into ye fyre.
040	MAT	003	011	I baptise you in water in toke of repentauce: but he ye cometh after me is myghtier then I whose shues I am not worthy to beare.  He shall baptise you with ye holy gost and with fyre:
040	MAT	003	012	which hath also his fan in his hod and will pourge his floure and gadre ye wheet into his garner and will burne ye chaffe with vnquecheable fyre
040	MAT	003	013	Then cam Iesus from Galile to Iordan vnto Ihon to be baptised of hym.
040	MAT	003	014	But Ihon forbade hym saynge: I ought to be baptysed of the: and comest thou to me?
040	MAT	003	015	Iesus answered and sayd to hym: Let it be so now.  For thus it becommeth vs to fulfyll all rightwesnes.  Then he suffred hym.
040	MAT	003	016	And Iesus assone as he was baptised came strayght out of ye water.  And lo heue was ope over hym: and Ihon sawe the spirite of God descende lyke a doue and lyght vpon hym.
040	MAT	003	017	And lo there came a voyce from heven sayng: Thys ys that my beloved sonne in whom is my delyte.
040	MAT	004	001	Then was Iesus ledd awaye of ye spirite into wildernes to be tempted of ye devyll.
040	MAT	004	002	And when he had fasted fourtye dayes and fourtye nightes he was afterward an hungred.
040	MAT	004	003	Then came to hym the tempter and sayde: yf thou be the sonne of God commaunde that these stones be made breed.
040	MAT	004	004	He answered and sayde: yt is wrytten man shall not lyve by brede onlye but by every worde yt proceadeth out of the mouth of God.
040	MAT	004	005	Then the devyll tooke hym vp into ye holy cite and set hym on a pynacle of the teple
040	MAT	004	006	and sayd vnto hym: yf thou be the sonne of God cast thy sylfe doune.  For it is wrytte he shall geve his angels charge over the and with their handes they shall holde yt vp that thou dashe not thy fote agaynst a stone.
040	MAT	004	007	And Iesus sayde to hym it ys wrytten also: Thou shalt not tempte thy Lorde God.
040	MAT	004	008	The devyll toke hym vp agayne and ledde hym in to an excedynge hye mountayne and shewed hym all the kyngdomes of ye worlde and all ye glorie of them
040	MAT	004	009	and sayde to hym: all these will I geue ye if thou wilt faull doune and worship me.
040	MAT	004	010	Then sayde Iesus vnto hym.  Avoyd Satan.  For it is writte thou shalt worshyp ye Lorde thy God and hym only shalt thou serve.
040	MAT	004	011	Then the dyvell left hym and beholde the angels came and ministred vnto hym.
040	MAT	004	012	When Iesus had hearde yt Ihon was taken he departed into Galile
040	MAT	004	013	and left Nazareth and went and dwelte in Capernaum which is a cite apon the see in ye coostes of zabulon and Neptalim
040	MAT	004	014	to fulfill that whiche was spoken by Esay the Prophet sayinge:
040	MAT	004	015	The londe of zabulon and Neptalim the waye of the see beyonde Iordan Galile of the Gentyls
040	MAT	004	016	ye people which sat in darknes sawe greate lyght and to them which sate in the region and shadowe of deeth lyght is begone to shyne.
040	MAT	004	017	From yt tyme Iesus begane to preache and to saye: repet for ye kigdome of heve is at hode.
040	MAT	004	018	As Iesus walked by the see of Galile he sawe two brethren: Simon which was called Peter and Andrew his brother castynge a neet into the see for they were fisshers
040	MAT	004	019	and he sayde vnto them folowe me and I will make you fisshers of men.
040	MAT	004	020	And they strayght waye lefte their nettes and folowed hym.
040	MAT	004	021	And he went forthe from thence and sawe other twoo brethren Iames the sonne of zebede and Ihon his brother in the shippe with zebede their father mendynge their nettes and called them.
040	MAT	004	022	And they with out taryinge lefte the shyp and their father and folowed hym.
040	MAT	004	023	And Iesus went aboute all Galile teachyng in their synagoges and preachynge ye gospell of the kyngdome and healed all maner of sicknes and all maner dyseases amoge ye people.
040	MAT	004	024	And his fame spreed abroode through oute all Siria.  And they brought vnto hym all sicke people that were taken with divers diseases and gripinges and them yt were possessed with devils and those which were lunatyke and those that had the palsie: and he healed the.
040	MAT	004	025	And ther folowed hym a greate nombre of people from Galile and from the ten cyties and from Ierusalem and from Iury and from ye regions that lye beyonde Iordan.
040	MAT	005	001	When he sawe the people he went vp into a mountayne and when he was set his disciples came to hym
040	MAT	005	002	and he opened hys mouthe and taught them sayinge:
040	MAT	005	003	Blessed are the povre in sprete: for theirs is the kyngdome of heven.
040	MAT	005	004	Blessed are they that morne: for they shalbe conforted.
040	MAT	005	005	Blessed are the meke: for they shall inheret the erth.
040	MAT	005	006	Blessed are they which honger and thurst for rightewesnes: for they shalbe filled.
040	MAT	005	007	Blessed are ye mercifull: for they shall obteyne mercy.
040	MAT	005	008	Blessed are the pure in herte: for they shall se God.
040	MAT	005	009	Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shalbe called the chyldren of God.
040	MAT	005	010	Blessed are they which suffre persecucio for rightwesnes sake: for theirs ys the kyngdome of heuen.
040	MAT	005	011	Blessed are ye when men reuyle you and persecute you and shall falsly say all manner of yvell saynges agaynst you for my sake.
040	MAT	005	012	Reioyce and be glad for greate is youre rewarde in heven.  For so persecuted they ye Prophetes which were before youre dayes.
040	MAT	005	013	ye are ye salt of the erthe: but and yf ye salt have lost hir saltnes what can be salted ther with?  It is thence forthe good for nothynge but to be cast oute and to be troade vnder fote of men.
040	MAT	005	014	Ye are ye light of the worlde.  A cite yt is set on an hill cannot be hid
040	MAT	005	015	nether do men lyght a cadell and put it vnder a busshell but on a candelstick and it lighteth all that are in the house.
040	MAT	005	016	Let youre light so shyne before men yt they maye se youre good workes and glorify youre father which is in heven.
040	MAT	005	017	Thinke not yt I am come to destroye the lawe or the Prophets: no I am nott come to destroye them but to fulfyll them.
040	MAT	005	018	For truely I saye vnto you till heven and erth perisshe one iott or one tytle of the lawe shall not scape tyll all be fulfilled.
040	MAT	005	019	Whosoever breaketh one of these lest commaundmentes and teacheth men so he shalbe called the leest in the kyngdome of heve.  But whosoever obserueth and teacheth ye same shal be called greate in the kyngdome of heven.
040	MAT	005	020	For I saye vnto you except youre rightewesnes excede the righetewesnes of ye Scribes and Pharises ye canot entre into ye kyngdome of heven.
040	MAT	005	021	Ye have herde howe it was sayd vnto the of ye olde tyme: Thou shalt not kyll.  For whoso ever kylleth shall be in daunger of iudgemet.
040	MAT	005	022	But I say vnto you whosoever is angre with hys brother shalbe in daunger of iudgement.  Whosoeuer sayeth vnto his brother Racha shalbe in dauger of a cousell.  But whosoeuer sayeth thou fole shalbe in dauger of hell fyre.
040	MAT	005	023	Therfore whe thou offrest thy gifte at the altare and their remembrest that thy brother hath ought agaynst the:
040	MAT	005	024	leue there thyne offrynge before the altre and go thy waye first and be reconcyled to thy brother and then come and offre thy gyfte.
040	MAT	005	025	Agre with thyne adversary quicklye whyles thou arte in ye waye with hym lest that adversary deliver ye to ye iudge and ye iudge delivre ye to ye minister and the thou be cast into preson.
040	MAT	005	026	I say vnto ye verely: thou shalt not come out thece till thou have payed ye utmost farthige.
040	MAT	005	027	Ye haue hearde howe it was sayde to the of olde tyme: Thou shalt not comitt advoutrie.
040	MAT	005	028	But I say vnto you that whosoeuer looketh on a wyfe lustynge after her hathe comitted advoutrie with hir alredy in his hert.
040	MAT	005	029	Wherfore yf thy right eye offende ye plucke hym out and caste him from the.  Better it is for the yt one of thy membres perisshe then that thy hole bodye shuld be cast into hell.
040	MAT	005	030	Also if thy right honde offend ye cut hym of and caste hym from the.  Better yt ys that one of thy membres perisshe then that all thy body shulde be caste in to hell.
040	MAT	005	031	It ys sayd whosoever put awaye his wyfe let hym geve her a testymonyall also of the devorcement.
040	MAT	005	032	But I say vnto you: whosoever put awaye his wyfe (except it be for fornicacion) causeth her to breake matrymony.  And whosoever maryeth her that is devorsed breaketh wedlocke.
040	MAT	005	033	Agayne ye haue hearde how it was sayd to the of olde tyme thou shalt not forsuere thy selfe but shalt performe thyne othe to God.
040	MAT	005	034	But I saye vnto you swere not at all nether by heue for it ys Goddes seate:
040	MAT	005	035	nor yet by the erth for it is his fote stole: nether by Ierusalem for it ys ye cyte of yt greate kynge:
040	MAT	005	036	nether shalt thou sweare by thy heed because thou canst not make one white heer or blacke:
040	MAT	005	037	But your comunicacion shalbe ye ye: nay nay.  For whatsoeuer is more then yt cometh of yvell.
040	MAT	005	038	Ye have hearde how it ys sayd an eye for an eye: a tothe for a tothe.
040	MAT	005	039	But I saye to you that ye resist not wroge.  But whosoever geve the a blowe on thy right cheke tourne to him the other.
040	MAT	005	040	And yf eny man will sue the at the lawe and take awaye thy coote let hym have thy cloocke also.
040	MAT	005	041	And whosoever wyll copell the to goo a myle goo wyth him twayne.
040	MAT	005	042	Geve to him that axeth and fro him that wolde borowe tourne not awaye.
040	MAT	005	043	Ye have hearde how it is sayde: thou shalt love thyne neghbour and hate thine enimy.
040	MAT	005	044	But I saye vnto you love youre enimies.  Blesse the that coursse you.  Do good to them that hate you.  Praye for them which doo you wronge and persecute you
040	MAT	005	045	that ye maye be ye chyldern of youre father that is in heauen: for he maketh his sunne to aryse on ye yvell and on the good and sendeth his reyn on the iuste and vniuste.
040	MAT	005	046	For yf ye love them which love you: what rewarde shall ye have?  Doo not the Publicans euen so?
040	MAT	005	047	And yf ye be frendly to youre brethren onlye: what singuler thynge doo ye?  Do not the Publicans lyke wyse?
040	MAT	005	048	ye shall therfore be perfecte eve as youre father which is in heauen is perfecte.
040	MAT	006	001	Take hede to youre almes.  That ye geve it not in the syght of men to the intent that ye wolde be sene of them.  Or els ye get no rewarde of youre father which is in heve.
040	MAT	006	002	Whe soever therfore thou gevest thine almes thou shalt not make a tropet to be blowe before the as ye ypocrites do in the synagogis and in the stretis for to be preysed of men.  Verely I say vnto you they have their rewarde.
040	MAT	006	003	But whe thou doest thine almes let not thy lyfte had knowe what thy righte had doth
040	MAT	006	004	yt thine almes may be secret: and thy father which seith in secret shall rewarde ye opely.
040	MAT	006	005	And when thou prayest thou shalt not be as ye ypocrytes are.  For they love to stond and praye in the synagoges and in the corners of ye stretes because they wolde be sene of men.  Verely I saye vnto you they haue their rewarde.
040	MAT	006	006	But when thou prayest entre into thy chamber and shut thy dore to the and praye to thy father which ys in secrete: and thy father which seith in secret shall rewarde the openly.
040	MAT	006	007	And whe ye praye bable not moche as the hethe do: for they thincke that they shalbe herde for their moche bablynges sake.
040	MAT	006	008	Be ye not lyke them therfore.  For youre father knoweth wherof ye haue neade before ye axe of him.
040	MAT	006	009	After thys maner therfore praye ye.  O oure father which arte in heve halowed be thy name.
040	MAT	006	010	Let thy kyngdome come.  Thy wyll be fulfilled as well in erth as it ys in heven.
040	MAT	006	011	Geve vs this daye oure dayly breede.
040	MAT	006	012	And forgeve vs oure treaspases eve as we forgeve oure trespacers.
040	MAT	006	013	And leade vs not into teptacion: but delyver vs fro evell.  For thyne is ye kyngedome and ye power and ye glorye for ever.  Amen.
040	MAT	006	014	For and yf ye shall forgeve other men their treaspases youre hevenly father shall also forgeve you.
040	MAT	006	015	But and ye wyll not forgeve men their trespases nomore shall youre father forgeve youre treaspases.
040	MAT	006	016	Moreoure when ye faste be not sad as ye ypocrytes are.  For they disfigure their faces that they myght be sene of me how they faste.  Verely I say vnto you they have their rewarde.
040	MAT	006	017	But thou whe thou fastest annoynte thyne heed and washe thy face
040	MAT	006	018	that it appere not vnto men howe that thou fastest: but vnto thy father which is in secrete: and thy father which seeth in secret shall rewarde the openly.
040	MAT	006	019	Se that ye gaddre you not treasure vpon ye erth where rust and mothes corrupte and where theves breake through and steale.
040	MAT	006	020	But gaddre ye treasure togeder in heve where nether rust nor mothes corrupte and where theves nether breake vp nor yet steale.
040	MAT	006	021	For where soever youre treasure ys there will youre hertes be also.
040	MAT	006	022	The light of the body is thyne eye.  Wher fore if thyne eye besyngle all thy body shalbe full of light.
040	MAT	006	023	But and if thyne eye be wycked then all thy body shalbe full of derckenes.  Wherfore yf the light that is in the be darckenes: how greate is that darckenes.
040	MAT	006	024	No ma can serve two masters.  For ether he shall hate the one and love the other: or els he shall lene to ye one and despise ye other: ye can not serve God and mammon.
040	MAT	006	025	Therfore I saye vnto you be not carefull for your lyfe what ye shall eate or what ye shall drincke nor yet for youre body what ye shall put on.  ys not ye lyfe more worth then meate and the body more of value then raymeut?
040	MAT	006	026	Beholde the foules of ye ayer: for they sowe not nether reepe nor yet cary into ye barnes: and yet youre hevely father fedeth the.  Are ye not moche better the they?
040	MAT	006	027	Which of you (though he toke thought therfore) coulde put one cubit vnto his stature?
040	MAT	006	028	And why care ye then for raymet?  Considre ye lylies of ye felde how they growe.  They labour not nether spynne.
040	MAT	006	029	And yet for all yt I saye vnto you yt eue Salomon in all his royalte was not arayed lyke vnto one of these.
040	MAT	006	030	Wherfore yf God so clothe the grasse which ys to daye in the felde and to morowe shalbe caste in to the fournace: shall he not moche more do the same vnto you o ye of lytle fayth?
040	MAT	006	031	Therfore take no thought sayinge: what shall we eate or what shall we drincke or wherwt shall we be clothed?
040	MAT	006	032	After all these thynges seke the getyls.  For youre hevely father knoweth that ye have neade of all these thynges.
040	MAT	006	033	But rather seke ye fyrst the kyngdome of heuen and the rightwisnes therof and all these thynges shalbe ministred vnto you.
040	MAT	006	034	Care not then for the morow but let ye morow care for it selfe: for the daye present hath ever ynough of his awne trouble.
040	MAT	007	001	Iudge not that ye be not iudged.
040	MAT	007	002	For as ye iudge so shall ye be iudged.  And wt what mesure ye mete wt the same shall it be mesured to you agayne.
040	MAT	007	003	Why seist thou a moote in thy brothers eye and perceavest not the beame yt ys yn thyne awne eye.
040	MAT	007	004	Or why sayest thou to thy brother: suffre me to plucke oute the moote oute of thyne eye and behold a beame is in thyne awne eye.
040	MAT	007	005	Ypocryte fyrst cast oute the beame oute of thyne awne eye and then shalte thou se clearly to plucke oute the moote out of thy brothers eye.
040	MAT	007	006	Geve not that which is holy to dogges nether cast ye youre pearles before swyne lest they treade them vnder their fete and ye other tourne agayne and all to rent you.
040	MAT	007	007	Axe and it shalbe geven you.  Seke and ye shall fynd.  knocke and it shalbe opened vnto you.
040	MAT	007	008	For whosoever axeth receaveth and he yt seketh fyndeth and to hym that knocketh it shalbe opened.
040	MAT	007	009	Ys there eny man amoge you which if his sonne axed hym bread wolde offer him astone?
040	MAT	007	010	Or if he axed fysshe wolde he proffer hym a serpet?
040	MAT	007	011	Yf ye then which are evyll cane geve to youre chyldren good gyftes: how moche moore shall youre father which is in heve geve good thynges to them yt axe hym?
040	MAT	007	012	Therfore whatsoever ye wolde that men shulde do to you even so do ye to them.  This ys the lawe and the Prophettes.
040	MAT	007	013	Enter in at the strayte gate: for wyde is ye gate and broade is the waye that leadeth to destruccion: and many ther be which goo yn therat.
040	MAT	007	014	But strayte is the gate and narowe ys the waye which leadeth vnto lyfe: and feawe there be that fynde it.
040	MAT	007	015	Beware of false Prophetes which come to you in shepes clothinge but inwardly they are ravenynge wolves.
040	MAT	007	016	Ye shall knowe them by their frutes.  Do men gaddre grapes of thornes?  or figges of bryres?
040	MAT	007	017	Euen soo every good tree bryngeth forthe good frute.  But a corrupte tree bryngethe forthe evyll frute.
040	MAT	007	018	A good tree canot brynge forthe bad frute: nor yet a bad tree can bringe forthe good frute.
040	MAT	007	019	Every tree that bryngethe not forthe good frute shalbe hewe doune and cast into the fyre.
040	MAT	007	020	Wherfore by their frutes ye shall knowe the.
040	MAT	007	021	Not all they that saye vnto me Master Master shall enter in to the kyngdome of heven: but he that dothe my fathers will which ys in heven.
040	MAT	007	022	Many will saye to me in that daye Master master have we not in thy name prophesied?  And in thy name have caste oute devyls?  And in thy name have done many miracles?
040	MAT	007	023	And then will I knowlege vnto them that I never knewe them.  Departe from me ye workers of iniquite.
040	MAT	007	024	Whosoever heareth of me these sayinges and doethe the same I wyll lyken hym vnto a wyse man which bylt hys housse on a rocke:
040	MAT	007	025	and aboundance of rayne descended and the fluddes came and the wyndes blewe and bet vpon that same housse and it fell not because it was grounded on the rocke.
040	MAT	007	026	And whosoever heareth of me these sayinges and doth the not shalbe lykened vnto a folysh man which bilt hys housse apo the sondes:
040	MAT	007	027	and abundauce of rayne descended and the fluddes came and ye wyndes blewe and beet vpon that housse and it fell and great was the fall of it.
040	MAT	007	028	And it came to passe that when Iesus had ended these saynges the people were astonnyed at hys doctryne.
040	MAT	007	029	For he taught them as one havynge power and not as the Scribes.
040	MAT	008	001	When he was come downe from the moutayne moch people folowed him.
040	MAT	008	002	And lo ther came a lepre and worsheped him sayinge: Master if thou wylt thou canst make me clene.
040	MAT	008	003	And Iesus put forthe hys hond and touched hym sayinge: I wyll be thou clene and immediatly hys leprosie was clensed.
040	MAT	008	004	And Iesus sayde vnto him.  Se thou tell no man but go and shewe thy selfe to the preste and offer the gyfte that Moses comaunded in witnes to them.
040	MAT	008	005	When Iesus was entred into Capernau ther came vnto him a certayne Centurion and besought hym
040	MAT	008	006	sayinge: Master my seruaunt lyeth sicke at home of ye palsye and ys greuously payned.
040	MAT	008	007	And Iesus sayd vnto hym: I will come and heale him.
040	MAT	008	008	The Centurio answered and sayde: Syr I am not worthy yt thou shuldest come vnder my rofe but speake ye worde only and my servaut shalbe healed.
040	MAT	008	009	For I also my selfe am a man vndre power and have sowdiers vndre me and I saye to one go and he goeth and to anothre come and he cometh: and to my seruaut do this and he doeth it.
040	MAT	008	010	When Iesus hearde yt he marveled and sayd to them yt folowed hym.  Derely I say vnto you I have not foude so great fayth: no not in Israel.
040	MAT	008	011	I say therfore vnto you that many shall come fro the eest and weest and shall rest wt Abraham Isaac and Iacob in the kingdome of heve:
040	MAT	008	012	and the chyldren of ye kyngdome shalbe cast out in to vtter darcknes: there shalbe wepinge and gnasshing of tethe.
040	MAT	008	013	The Iesus sayd vnto ye Centurion go thy waye and as thou belevest so be it vnto the.  And his servaunt was healed the selfe houre.
040	MAT	008	014	And then Iesus went to Peters housse and sawe hys wyves mother lyinge sicke of a fevre
040	MAT	008	015	and touched her hande and the fevre left hir: and she arose and ministred vnto them.
040	MAT	008	016	When the eue was come they brought vn to him many yt were possessed with devyllis.  And he cast out ye spirites with a worde and healed all yt were sicke
040	MAT	008	017	to fulfill yt which was spoke by Esayas ye Prophet sayinge.  He toke on him oure infirmities and bare oure sickneses.
040	MAT	008	018	Whe Iesus sawe moche people about him he comaunded to go over ye water.
040	MAT	008	019	And ther came a scribe and sayd vnto hym: master I wyll folowe ye whyther so ever thou goest.
040	MAT	008	020	And Iesus sayd vnto him: the foxes have holes and the bryddes of the ayer have nestes but ye sonne of the man hath not whero to rest his heede.
040	MAT	008	021	A nothre yt was one of hys disciples sayd vnto hym: master suffre me fyrst to go and burye my father.
040	MAT	008	022	But Iesus sayd vnto him: folowe me and let the deed burie their deed.
040	MAT	008	023	And he entred in to a shyppe and his disciples folowed him.
040	MAT	008	024	And beholde there arose a a greate tepest in ye see in so moche yt the shippe was covered wt waves and he was a slepe.
040	MAT	008	025	And his disciples came vn to him and awoke hym sayinge: master save vs we perishe.
040	MAT	008	026	And he sayd vnto them: why are ye fearfull o ye of lytell faithe?  Then he arose and rebuked ye wyndes and the see and ther folowed a greate calme.
040	MAT	008	027	And the men marveyled and sayd: what man is this that bothe wyndes and see obey hym?
040	MAT	008	028	And when he was come to ye other syde in to ye coutre of ye Gergesites ther met him two possessed of devylles which came out of the graves and were out of measure fearce so yt no ma myght go by that waye.
040	MAT	008	029	And behold they cryed out sayinge: O Iesu the sonne of God what have we to do with the?  Art thou come hyther to tormet vs before the tyme be come?
040	MAT	008	030	And ther was a good waye of fro them a greate heerd of swyne fedinge.
040	MAT	008	031	Then ye devyles besought him sayinge: if thou cast vs out suffre vs to go oure waye in to the heerd of swyne.
040	MAT	008	032	And he sayd vnto the: go youre wayes.  Then wet they out and departed into ye heerd of swyne And beholde ye whoale heerd of swyne was caryed wt violence hedlinge in to the see and perisshed in ye water.
040	MAT	008	033	Then ye heerdme fleed and wet their ways in to ye cyte and tolde every thinge and what had fortuned vnto the possessed of the devyls.
040	MAT	008	034	And beholde all the cyte came out and met Iesus.  And when they sawe hym they besought hym to departe oute of their costes.
040	MAT	009	001	Then he entred in to a shippe and passed over and came in to his awne cite.
040	MAT	009	002	And lo they brought to him a ma sicke of ye palsie lyinge in his bed.  And when Iesus sawe ye faith of the he sayd to the sicke of ye palsie: sonne be of good chere thy sinnes be forgeve the.
040	MAT	009	003	And beholde certeyne of ye scribes sayd in the selves this ma blasphemeth.
040	MAT	009	004	And whe Iesus sawe their thoughtes he sayd: wherfore thinke ye evill in youre hertes?
040	MAT	009	005	Whether ys esyer to saye thy synnes be forgeven ye or to saye: arise and walke?
040	MAT	009	006	That ye maye knowe that ye sonne of ma hath power to forgeve sinnes in erth then sayd he vnto ye sicke of ye palsye: arise take vp thy beed and go home to thine housse.
040	MAT	009	007	And he arose and departed to his awne housse.
040	MAT	009	008	And when ye people sawe it they marveyled and glorified god which had geve suche power to me.
040	MAT	009	009	And as Iesus passed forth fro thence he sawe a ma syt a receyuinge of custome named Mathew and sayd to him: folowe me.
040	MAT	009	010	And he arose and folowed him.  And it came to passe as he sat at meate in the housse: beholde many publicans and synners came and sate downe also with Iesus and hys disciples.
040	MAT	009	011	When the Pharises sawe that they sayd to hys disciples: why eateth youre master wt publicans and synners?
040	MAT	009	012	When Iesus herde that he sayde vnto them: The whole neade not the phisicion but they that are sicke.
040	MAT	009	013	Goo and learne what that meaneth: I have pleasure in mercy and not in offerynge.  For I am not come to call the rightewes but the synners to repentaunce.
040	MAT	009	014	Then came ye disciples of Ihon to hym sayinge: why do we and the Pharises fast ofte: but thy disciples fast not?
040	MAT	009	015	And Iesus sayde vnto them: Can ye weddynge chyldren morne as longe as ye bridegrome is wt them?  The tyme will come whe the bridegrome shalbe take fro them and then shall they faste.
040	MAT	009	016	Noo man peceth and olde garment with a pece of newe cloothe.  For then taketh he awaye ye pece agayne from the garmet and the rent ys made greater.
040	MAT	009	017	Nether do men put newe wyne into olde vessels for then the vessels breake and the wyne runneth oute and the vessels perysshe.  But they powre newe wyne into newe vessels and so are both saved togeder.
040	MAT	009	018	Whyls he thus spake vnto the beholde ther came a certayne ruler and worshipped him sayinge: my doghter is euen now deceased but come and lay thy honde on her and she shall live.
040	MAT	009	019	And Iesus arose and folowed hym with hys disciples.
040	MAT	009	020	And beholde a woman which was diseased wt an yssue of bloude. xii.  yeres came behynde hym and toched ye hem of hys vesture.
040	MAT	009	021	For she sayd in her silfe: yf I maye toche but even his vesture only I shalbe safe.
040	MAT	009	022	Then Iesus tourned him about and behelde her sayinge: Doughter be of good conforte thy faith hath made the safe.  And she was made whole even that same houre.
040	MAT	009	023	And when Iesus came into ye rulers housse and sawe the minstrels and the people raginge
040	MAT	009	024	he sayde vnto them: Get you hence for ye mayde is not deed but slepeth.  And they laughed hym to scorne.
040	MAT	009	025	Assone as ye people were put forthe he went in and toke her by ye hond and the mayde arose.
040	MAT	009	026	And this was noysed through out all that lande.
040	MAT	009	027	And as Iesus departed thence two blynde men folowed hym crying and saying: O thou sonne of David have mercy on vs.
040	MAT	009	028	And when he was come to housse the blynd came to hym And Iesus sayde vnto them: Beleve ye that I am able to do thys?  And they sayde vnto hym: ye Lorde.
040	MAT	009	029	Then touched he their eyes saying: acordynge to youre faythe be it vnto you.
040	MAT	009	030	And their eyes were opened.  And Iesus charged the saying: Se yt no man knowe of it.
040	MAT	009	031	But they assone as they were departed spreed abroade his name through oute all the londe.
040	MAT	009	032	As they went out beholde they brought to hym a dome ma possessed af a devyll.
040	MAT	009	033	And as sone as the devyll was cast oute the domme spake: And the people merveled sayinge: it was never so sene in Israel.
040	MAT	009	034	But the Pharises sayde: he casteth oute devyls by the power of the chefe devyll.
040	MAT	009	035	And Iesus went about all cities and tounes teachynge in their synagoges and preachyng the glad tidinges of ye kyngdome and healinge all maner sicknes and desease amoge ye people.
040	MAT	009	036	But when he sawe the people he had copassion on the because they were pyned awaye and scattered abroade eve as shepe havige no shepherd.
040	MAT	009	037	Then sayde he to hys disciples: the hervest is greate but the laborers are feawe.
040	MAT	009	038	Wherfore praye the Lorde of the harvest to sende forthe laborers into hys harvest.
040	MAT	010	001	And he called his. xii.  disciples vnto hym and gave them power over vnclene sprites to cast them oute and to heale all maner of sicknesses and all maner of deseases.
040	MAT	010	002	The names of the. xii.  Apostles are these.  The fyrst Simon called also Peter: and Andrew his brother.  Iames the sonne of zebede aud Ihon his brother.
040	MAT	010	003	Philip and Bartlemew.  Thomas and Mathew the Publican.  Iames the sonne of Alphe and Lebbeus otherwyse called Taddeus.
040	MAT	010	004	Simon of Cane and Iudas Iscarioth which also betrayed hym.
040	MAT	010	005	These. xii.  sent Iesus and comaunded them sayinge: Go not in to ye wayes yt leade to the gentyls and in to ye cities of ye Samaritans enter ye not.
040	MAT	010	006	But go rather to ye lost shepe of the housse of Israel.
040	MAT	010	007	Go and preach sayinge: yt the kyngdome of heve is at hande.
040	MAT	010	008	Heale the sicke clense the lepers rayse the deed caste oute the devils.  Frely ye have receved frely geve agayne.
040	MAT	010	009	Posses not golde nor silver nor brassse yn youre gerdels
040	MAT	010	010	nor yet scrip towardes your iorney: nether two cotes nether shues nor yet a staffe.  For the workma is worthy to have his meate.
040	MAT	010	011	In to whatsoever cite or toune ye shall come enquyre who ys worthy yn it and there abyde till ye goo thence.
040	MAT	010	012	And whe ye come in to an housse salute ye same.
040	MAT	010	013	And yf the housse be worthy youre peace shall come apon it.  But yf it be not worthy youre peace shall retourne to you agayne.
040	MAT	010	014	And whosoever shall not receave you nor will heare youre preachynge: when ye departe oute of yt housse or that cite shake of the duste of youre fete.
040	MAT	010	015	Truly I say vnto you: it shalbe easier for the londe of zodoma and Gomorra in the daye of iudgement then for that cite.
040	MAT	010	016	Beholde I sende you forthe as shepe amoge wolves.  Be ye therfore wyse as serpetes and innocent as doves.
040	MAT	010	017	Beware of men for they shall deliver you vp to ye cousels and shall scourge you in their synagoges.
040	MAT	010	018	And ye shall be brought to the heed rulers and kynges for my sake in witnes to them and to the gentyls.
040	MAT	010	019	But when they delyver you vp take no thought how or what ye shall speake for yt shalbe geve you eve in that same houre what ye shall saye.
040	MAT	010	020	For it is not ye that speke but ye sprite of your father which speaketh in you.
040	MAT	010	021	The brother shall betraye the brother to deeth and the father the sonne.  And the chyldre shall aryse agaynste their fathers and mothers and shall put them to deethe:
040	MAT	010	022	and ye shall be hated of all me for my name.  But he that endureth to the ende shalbe saved.
040	MAT	010	023	When they persecute you in one cite flye in to another.  I tell you for a treuth ye shall not fynysshe all yt cities of Israel tyll ye sonne of man be come.
040	MAT	010	024	The disciple ys not above hys master: nor yet ye servaut above his lorde.
040	MAT	010	025	It is ynough for the disciple to be as hys master ys and that the servaunt be as his lorde ys.  yf they have called the lorde of the housse beelzebub: how moche more shall they call them of his housholde so?
040	MAT	010	026	Feare the not therfore.  There is no thinge so close that shall not be openned and no thinge so hyd that shall not be knowen.
040	MAT	010	027	What I tell you in dercknes that speake ye in lyght.  And what ye heare in the eare that preache ye on the housse toppes.
040	MAT	010	028	And feare ye not them which kyll the body and be not able to kyll the soule.  But rather feare hym which is able to destroye bothe soule and body into hell.
040	MAT	010	029	Are not two sparowes solde for a farthinge?  And none of them dothe lyght on the grounde with out youre father.
040	MAT	010	030	And now are all the heeris of youre heedis numbred.
040	MAT	010	031	Feare ye not therfore: ye are of more value then many sparowes.
040	MAT	010	032	Who soever therfore shall knowledge me before men hym will I knowledge also before my father which is in heuen.
040	MAT	010	033	But whoso ever shall denye me before men hym will I also denye before my father which is in heven.
040	MAT	010	034	Thynke not that I am come to sende peace into the erth.  I came not to send peace but a swearde.
040	MAT	010	035	For I am come to set a man at varyaunce ageynst hys father and the doughter ageynst hyr mother and the doughterlawe ageynst her motherlawe:
040	MAT	010	036	And a mannes fooes shalbe they of hys owne housholde.
040	MAT	010	037	He that lovith hys father or mother more then me is not mete for me.  And he that loveth his sonne or doughter more then me is not mete for me.
040	MAT	010	038	And he yt taketh not his crosse and foloweth me ys not mete for me.
040	MAT	010	039	He that fyndeth hys lyfe shall lose it: and he that losith hys lyfe for my sake shall fynde it.
040	MAT	010	040	He that receavith you receavith me: and he that receavith me receavith him that sent me.
040	MAT	010	041	He that receavith a prophet in ye name of a prophet shall receave a prophetes rewarde.  And he that receavith a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receave the rewarde of a righteous man.
040	MAT	010	042	And whosoever shall geve vnto one of these lytle ones to drincke a cuppe of colde water only in the name of a disciple: I tel you of a trueth he shall not lose his rewarde.
040	MAT	011	001	And it came to passe when Iesus had made an ende of comaundinge his. xii.  disciples that he departed thence to teache and to preache in their cities.
040	MAT	011	002	When Ihon beinge in preson hearde ye workes of Christ he sent two of his disciples
040	MAT	011	003	and sayde vnto him.  Arte thou he that shall come: or shall we loke for another.
040	MAT	011	004	Iesus answered and sayde vnto them.  Go and shewe Ihon what ye have hearde and sene.
040	MAT	011	005	The blynd se the halt goo the lepers are clensed: the deef heare the ded ryse ageyne and the glad tidinges is preached to the povre.
040	MAT	011	006	And happy is he that is not offended by me.
040	MAT	011	007	And as they departed Iesus begane to speake vnto the people of Ihon.  What for to se wet ye out in to the wyldernes?  wet ye out to se a rede shake with ye wynde?
040	MAT	011	008	other what wet ye out for to se?  A man clothed in soofte raymet: ?  Beholde they yt weare soofte clothig are in kynges howses.
040	MAT	011	009	But what wet ye oute for to se?  A prophete?  Ye I saye to you and more the a prophete.
040	MAT	011	010	For this is he of who it is wrytte.  Beholde I sende my messenger before thy face which shall prepare thy waye before ye.
040	MAT	011	011	Verely I saye vnto you amonge ye chyldren of wemen arose there not a gretter then Ihon the baptist.  Notwithstondinge he that ys lesse in the kyngdome of heven ys gretter then he.
040	MAT	011	012	From the tyme of Ihon Baptist hytherto ye kyngdome of heve suffreth violence and they that go to it with violence pluck it vnto them.
040	MAT	011	013	For all the prophetes and the lawe prophesyed vnto to the tyme of Ihon.
040	MAT	011	014	Also yf ye wyll receave it this is Helyas which shuld come.
040	MAT	011	015	He yt hathe eares to heare let him heare.
040	MAT	011	016	But wher vnto shall I lyken this generacion?  It ys lyke vnto chyldre which syt in the market and call vnto their felowes
040	MAT	011	017	and saye: we have pyped vnto you and ye have not daunsed?  We have morned vnto you and ye have not sorowed.
040	MAT	011	018	For Ihon came nether eatinge nor drinkinge and they saye he hath the devyll.
040	MAT	011	019	The sonne of man came eatinge and drinkinge and they saye beholde a glutton and drynker of wyne and a frend vnto publicas and synners.  Never the later wysdome ys iustified of hir children.
040	MAT	011	020	Then bega he to vpbrayd the cities in which most of his miracles were done because they meded not.
040	MAT	011	021	Wo be to ye Chorasin.  Wo be to ye Betzaida: for if the miracles which were shewd in you had bene done in Tyre and Sidon they had repented longe agone in sackcloth and asshes.
040	MAT	011	022	Neverthelesse I say to you: it shall be esier for Tyre and Sidon at the day of iudgemet then for you.
040	MAT	011	023	And thou Capernau which art lift vp vnto heve shalt be brought doune to hell.  For if the miracles which have bene done in the had bene shewed in zodom: they had remayned to this daye.
040	MAT	011	024	Neverthelesse I saye vnto you: it shalbe easiar for ye londe of zodo in the daye of iudgemet the for ye.
040	MAT	011	025	At yt tyme Iesus answered and sayd: I prayse ye o father lorde of heve and erth because thou hast hid these thinges fro the wyse and prudet and hast opened the vnto babes:
040	MAT	011	026	eve so father for so it pleased ye.
040	MAT	011	027	All thinges are geve vnto me of my father.  And noma knoweth ye sonne but ye father: nether knoweth eny ma ye father save ye sonne and he to whome ye sonne will ope him.
040	MAT	011	028	Come vnto me all ye that laboure and are laden and I wyll ease you.
040	MAT	011	029	Take my yoke on you and lerne of me for I am meke and lowly in herte: and ye shall fynd rest vnto youre soules.
040	MAT	011	030	For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.
040	MAT	012	001	In that tyme went Iesus on the Sabot dayes thorow the corne and his disciples were anhogred and begane to plucke the eares of coorne and to eate.
040	MAT	012	002	When ye pharises sawe that they sayde vnto him: Beholde thy disciples do that which is not lawfull to do apon ye saboth daye.
040	MAT	012	003	He sayde vnto the: Haue ye not reed what David did whe he was anhougered and they also which were with him?
040	MAT	012	004	How he entred into the housse of God and ate ye halowed loves which were not lawfull for him to eate nether for the which were wt him but only for ye prestes.
040	MAT	012	005	Or have ye not reed in ye lawe how that ye prestes in ye temple breake the saboth daye and yet are blamlesse?
040	MAT	012	006	But I saye vnto you: that here is one greater then ye teple.
040	MAT	012	007	Wherfore yf ye had wist what this sayinge meneth: I require mercy and not sacrifice: ye wold never have condened innocetes.
040	MAT	012	008	For ye sonne of man is lord even of ye saboth daye.
040	MAT	012	009	And he departed thence and went into their synagoge:
040	MAT	012	010	and beholde ther was a man whiche had his hande dryed vp.  And they axed him sayinge: ys it lawfull to heale apon ye saboth dayes?  because they myght acuse him.
040	MAT	012	011	And he sayde vnto the: whiche of you wolde it be yf he had a shepe fallen into a pitte on ye saboth daye that wolde not take him and lyft him out?
040	MAT	012	012	And how moche is a man better the a shepe?  Wherfore it is lefull to do a good dede on the saboth dayes.
040	MAT	012	013	Then sayde he to ye ma: stretch forth thy had.  And he stretched it forthe.  And it was made whole agayne lyke vnto ye other.
040	MAT	012	014	Then ye Pharyses wet out and helde a cousell agaynst hym how they myght destroye hym.
040	MAT	012	015	When Iesus knewe yt he departed thece and moche people folowed him and he healed the all
040	MAT	012	016	and charged the that they shuld not make him knowe:
040	MAT	012	017	to fulfyll that which was spoden by Esay ye Prophet which sayeth.
040	MAT	012	018	Beholde my chylde who I have chosen my beloved in who my soule deliteth.  I wyll put my sprete on hym and he shall shewe iudgemet to ye gentyls.
040	MAT	012	019	He shall not stryve he shall not crye nether shall eny man heare his voyce in ye streetes
040	MAT	012	020	a brosed rede shall he not breacke and flaxe that begynneth to burne he shall not queche tyll he sende forth iudgement vnto victory
040	MAT	012	021	and in hys name shall the gentyls truste.
040	MAT	012	022	Then was brought to hym one possessed with a devyll which was both blynde and domme: and he healed hym insomoch that he which was blynd and domme both spake and sawe.
040	MAT	012	023	And all the people were amased and sayde: Ys not this that sonne of David?
040	MAT	012	024	But when the Pharises hearde that they sayde: This felow dryveth ye devyls no nother wyse oute but by the helpe of Belzebub ye chefe of the devyls.
040	MAT	012	025	But Iesus knewe their thoughtes and sayde to the.  Every kingdome devided wt in it sylfe shalbe brought to naught.  Nether shall eny cite or housholde devyded agest it sylfe cotynue.
040	MAT	012	026	So if sata cast out sata the is he devyded agenst him sylfe.  How shall then his kyngdome endure?
040	MAT	012	027	Also if I by ye helpe of Belzebub cast oute devyls: by whose helpe do youre chyldren cast them out?  Therfore they shalbe youre iudges.
040	MAT	012	028	But if I cast out the devyls by the sprite of God: then is the kyngdome of god come on you?
040	MAT	012	029	Ether how can a ma enter into a stroge manes housse and violently take awaye his goodes: excepte he fyrst binde ye stroge man and the spoyle his housse?
040	MAT	012	030	He that is not wt me is agaynst me.  And he yt gaddereth not wt me scattereth abrode.
040	MAT	012	031	Wherfore I say vnto you all maner of synne and blasphemy shalbe forgeven vnto men: but the blasphemy of ye sprite shall not be forgeven vnto men.
040	MAT	012	032	And whoso ever speaketh a worde agaynst the sonne of man it shalbe forgeven him.  But whosoever speaketh agaynst the holy goost it shall not be forgeven hym: no nether in this worlde nether in the worlde to come.
040	MAT	012	033	Ether make ye tree good and his frute good also: or els make ye tree evyll and his frute evyll also.  For ye tree is knowe by his frute.
040	MAT	012	034	O generacio of viperes how can ye saye well whe ye youre selves are evyll?  For of ye aboundace of the hert ye mouthe speaketh.
040	MAT	012	035	A good ma oute of ye good treasure of his hert bringeth forth good thynges.  And an evyll man out of his evyll treasure bringeth forth evyll thinges.
040	MAT	012	036	But I say vnto you that of every ydell worde that men shall have spoken: they shall geve acountes at the daye of iudgement.
040	MAT	012	037	For by thy wordes thou shalt be iustifyed: and by thy wordes thou shalt be condemned.
040	MAT	012	038	Then answered certeyne of the scribes and of the Pharises sayinge: Master we wolde fayne se a sygne of ye.
040	MAT	012	039	He answered and sayde to the: The evyll and advoutrous generacio seketh a signe but ther shall no signe be geve to the saue the signe of the Prophete Ionas.
040	MAT	012	040	For as Ionas was thre dayes and thre nyghtes in the whales belly: soo shall ye sonne of man be thre dayes and thre nyghtes in ye hert of ye erth.
040	MAT	012	041	The men of Ninivie shall rise at the daye of iugdement with this nacion and condemne them: for they amended at ye preachinge of Ionas.  And beholde a greater then Ionas is here.
040	MAT	012	042	The quene of ye south shall ryse at ye daye of iudgement with this generacion and shall condemne the: for she came fro the vtmost parties of the worlde to heare the wysdome of Salomon.  And beholde a greater then Salomo is here.
040	MAT	012	043	When the vnclene sprite is gone out of a man he walketh throughout dry places seking reest and fyndeth none.
040	MAT	012	044	Then he sayeth: I will retourne ageyne into my housse fro whece I came oute.  And when he is come he fyndeth the housse empty and swepte and garnisshed.
040	MAT	012	045	Then he goeth his waye and taketh vnto him seven other spretes worsse then himsilfe and so entre they in and dwell there.  And the ende of that man is worsse then the beginning.  Even so shall it be with this evell nacion.
040	MAT	012	046	Whill he yet talked to the people: beholde his mother and his brethren stode without desyringe to speake with him.
040	MAT	012	047	Then one sayde vnto hym: beholde thy mother and thy brethre stonde without desiringe to speke wt the.
040	MAT	012	048	He answered and sayd to him that tolde hym: Who is my mother?  or who are my brethren?
040	MAT	012	049	And he stretched forth his hond over his disciples and sayd: behold my mother and my brethren.
040	MAT	012	050	For whosoever dothe my fathers will which is in heve the same is my brother suster and mother.
040	MAT	013	001	The same daye wet Iesus out of ye house and sat by the seesyde
040	MAT	013	002	and moch people resorted vnto him so gretly yt he wet and sat in a shippe and all the people stode on ye shoore.
040	MAT	013	003	And he spake many thynges to the in similitudes sayinge: Beholde ye sower wet forth to sowe.
040	MAT	013	004	And as he sowed some fell by ye wayessyde and the fowlles came and devoured it vp.
040	MAT	013	005	Some fell apo stony groude where it had not moche erth and a none it sproge vp because it had no depth of erth:
040	MAT	013	006	and when ye sunne was vp it cauht heet and for lake of rotynge wyddred awaye.
040	MAT	013	007	Some fell amoge thornes and the thornes sproge vp and chooked it.
040	MAT	013	008	Parte fell in good groud and brought forth good frute: some an hudred fold some sixtie fold some thyrty folde.
040	MAT	013	009	Whosoever hath eares to heare let him heare.
040	MAT	013	010	And the disciples came and sayde to him: Why speakest thou to the in parables?
040	MAT	013	011	He answered and sayde vnto them: it is geve vnto you to knowe ye secretes of the kyngdome of heve but to the it is not geve.
040	MAT	013	012	For whosoever hath to him shall be geven: and he shall have aboundance.  But whosoever hath not: fro hym shalbe takyn awaye even that he hath.
040	MAT	013	013	Therfore speake I to them in similitudes: for though they se they se not: and hearinge they heare not: nether vnderstonde.
040	MAT	013	014	And in the is fulfilled ye Prophesie of Esayas which prophesie sayth: with the eares ye shall heare and shall not vnderstonde and with the eyes ye shall se and shall not perceave.
040	MAT	013	015	For this peoples hertes are wexed grosse and their eares were dull of herynge and their eyes have they closed lest they shulde se with their eyes and heare with their eares and shuld vnderstonde with their hertes and shuld tourne that I myght heale them.
040	MAT	013	016	But blessed are youre eyes for they se: and youre eares for they heare.
040	MAT	013	017	Verely I say vnto you that many Prophetes and perfaicte me have desired to se tho thinges which ye se and have not sene the: and to heare tho thinges which ye heare and have not herde the.
040	MAT	013	018	Heare ye therfore ye similitude of the sower.
040	MAT	013	019	Whosoever heareth the worde of ye kingdome and vnderstondeth it not ther cometh the evyll ma and catcheth awaye yt which was sowne in his hert.  And this is he which was sowne by the wayesyde.
040	MAT	013	020	But he yt was sowne in ye stony groude is he which heareth the worde of God and anone wt ioye receaveth it
040	MAT	013	021	yet hath he no rottes in him selfe and therfore dureth but a season: for assone as tribulacion or persecucion aryseth because of the worde by and by he falleth.
040	MAT	013	022	He yt was sowne amoge thornes is he yt heareth ye worde of God: but the care of this worlde and the dissaytfulnes of ryches choke ye worde and so is he made vnfrutfull.
040	MAT	013	023	He which is sowne in ye good grounde is he yt heareth ye worde and vnderstodeth it which also bereth frute and bringeth forth some an.  C.  folde some sixtie folde and some. xxx.  folde.
040	MAT	013	024	Another similitude put he forth vnto the sayinge: The kyngdome of heve is lyke vnto a man which sowed good seed in his felde.
040	MAT	013	025	But whyll men slepte ther came his foo and sowed tares amoge ye wheate and wet his waye.
040	MAT	013	026	When ye blade was sproge vp and had brought forth frute the appered ye tares also.
040	MAT	013	027	The servauntes came to the housholder and sayde vnto him: Syr sowedest not thou good seed in thy closse fro whece the hath it tares?
040	MAT	013	028	He sayde to the the envious ma hath done this.  Then ye servauntes sayde vnto him: wilt thou then yt we go and gader them?
040	MAT	013	029	But he sayde nay lest whill ye go aboute to wede out ye tares ye plucke vppe also wt them ye wheate by ye rottes:
040	MAT	013	030	let bothe growe to gether tyll harvest come and in tyme of harvest I wyll saye to the repers gather ye fyrst ye tares and bind the in sheves to be bret: but gather the wheete into my barne.
040	MAT	013	031	Another parable he put forthe vnto the sayinge.  The kyngdome of heve is lyke vnto a grayne of mustard seed which a ma taketh and soweth in his felde
040	MAT	013	032	which is ye leest of all seedes.  But when it is groune it is the greatest amoge yerbes and it is a tree: so yt the bryddes of the ayer come and bylde in the brauches of it.
040	MAT	013	033	Another similitude sayde he to them.  The kyngdome of heven is lyke vnto leve which a woman taketh and hydeth in. iii.  peckes of meele tyll all be levended.
040	MAT	013	034	All these thynge spake Iesus vnto the people by similitudes and with oute similitudes spake he nothinge to them
040	MAT	013	035	to fulfyll that which was spoke by the Prophet sayinge: I wyll ope my mouth in similitudes and wyll speake forth thinges which have bene kepte secrete from the begynninge of the worlde.
040	MAT	013	036	Then sent Iesus ye people awaye and came to housse.  And his disciples came vnto him sayinge: declare vnto vs the similitude of the tares of the felde.
040	MAT	013	037	Then answered he and sayde to them.  He that soweth the good seed is the sonne of man.
040	MAT	013	038	And ye felde is the worlde.  And the chyldre of the kingdome they are ye good seed.  And the tares are the chyldren of ye wicked.
040	MAT	013	039	And the enemye that soweth the is ye devell.  The harvest is ye end of the worlde.  And the repers be ye angels.
040	MAT	013	040	For eve as the tares are gaddred and bret in ye fyre: so shall it be in ye ende of this worlde.
040	MAT	013	041	The sonne of man shall send forth his angels and they shall gather out of his kyngdome all thinges that offende and them which do iniquite
040	MAT	013	042	and shall cast them into a furnes of fyre.  There shalbe waylynge and gnasshing of teth.
040	MAT	013	043	Then shall the iuste men shyne as bryght as the sunne in ye kyngdome of their father.  Whosoever hath eares to heare let him heare.
040	MAT	013	044	Agayne ye kyngdome of heve is lyke vnto treasure hidde in the felde ye which a man fyndeth and hideth: and for ioy therof goeth and selleth all that he hath and byeth that felde.
040	MAT	013	045	Agayne ye kyngdome of heve is lyke vnto a marchaunt that seketh good pearles
040	MAT	013	046	which when he had founde one precious pearle wet and solde all that he had and bought it.
040	MAT	013	047	Agayne the kyngdome of heve is lyke vnto a neet cast into ye see yt gadereth of all kyndes of fysshes:
040	MAT	013	048	which whe it is full men drawe to londe and sitte and gadre the good into vessels and cast the bad awaye.
040	MAT	013	049	So shall it be at the ende of the worlde.  The angels shall come oute and sever the bad from the good
040	MAT	013	050	and shall cast them into a furnes of fyre: there shalbe waylinge and gnasshynge of teth.
040	MAT	013	051	Iesus sayde vnto them: vnderstonde ye all these thynges?  They sayde ye Lorde.
040	MAT	013	052	The sayde he vnto them: Therfore every scribe which is taught vnto the kyngdome of heve is lyke an housholder which bryngeth forth out of hys treasure thynges bothe new and olde.
040	MAT	013	053	And it came to passe when Iesus had finisshed these similitudes yt he departed thece
040	MAT	013	054	and came in to his awne coutre and taught them in their synagoges in so moche yt they were astonyed and sayde: whece cometh all this wysdome and power vnto him?
040	MAT	013	055	Is not this the carpeters sonne?  Is not his mother called Mary?  and his brethre be called Iames and Ioses and Simo and Iudas?
040	MAT	013	056	And are not his susters all here wt vs?  Whece hath he all these thynge.
040	MAT	013	057	And they were offended by him.  The Iesus sayd to the a Prophet is not wt out honoure save in hys awne countre and amoge his awne kynne.
040	MAT	013	058	And he dyd not many miracles there for there vnbelefes sake.
040	MAT	014	001	At that tyme Herod the tetrarcha hearde of the fame of Iesu
040	MAT	014	002	and sayde vnto his servautes: This is Ihon ye baptist.  He is risen agayne from deeth and therfore are soche myracles wrought by him.
040	MAT	014	003	For Herod had taken Ihon and bounde him and put him in preson for Herodias sake his brother Philips wyfe.
040	MAT	014	004	For Ihon sayde vnto him: Yt is not lawfull for the to have her.
040	MAT	014	005	And when he wold have put him to deeth he feared the people because they counted him as a prophet.
040	MAT	014	006	But when Herodes birth daye was come the doughter of Herodias daunsed before them and pleased Herod.
040	MAT	014	007	Wherfore he promised wt an oth that he wolde geve hir whatsoever she wolde axe.
040	MAT	014	008	And she beinge informed of her mother before sayde: geve me here Ihon baptistes heed in a platter.
040	MAT	014	009	And ye kynge sorowed.  Neverthelesse for his othes sake and for their sakis which sate also at ye table he comaunded yt to be geven hir:
040	MAT	014	010	and sent and beheeded Ihon in the preson
040	MAT	014	011	and his heed was brought in a platter and geven to the damsell and she brought it to her mother.
040	MAT	014	012	And his disciples came and toke vp his body and buryed it: and went and tolde Iesus.
040	MAT	014	013	When Iesus hearde that he departed thence by shippe in to a desert place out of ye waye.  And when the people had hearde therof they folowed him afote out of their cities.
040	MAT	014	014	And Iesus went forth and sawe moche people and his herte did melte vpon them and he healed of them those that were sicke.
040	MAT	014	015	When even was come his disciples came to him sayinge.  This is a deserte place and the daye is spent: let the people departe yt they maye go into ye tounes and bye them vytayllis.
040	MAT	014	016	But Iesus sayde vnto them.  They have no neade to go awaye.  Geve ye the to eate.
040	MAT	014	017	Then sayde they vnto him: we have here but. v.  loves and two fysshes.
040	MAT	014	018	And he sayde: bringe the hyther to me.
040	MAT	014	019	And he comaunded ye people to syt downe on ye grasse: and toke ye. v.  loves and the. ii.  fysshes and loked vp to heven and blessed and brake and gave the loves to his disciples and the disciples gave them to ye people.
040	MAT	014	020	And they dyd all eate and were suffised.  And they gadered vp of ye gobbetes that remayned vii.  basketes full.
040	MAT	014	021	And they yt ate werein nobre about. v.  M.  men besyde wemen and chyldren.
040	MAT	014	022	And strayght waye Iesus made his disciples enter into a shippe and to goo over before him whill he sent ye people awaye.
040	MAT	014	023	And assone as he had sent the people awaye he went vp into a moutayne alone to praye.  And when nyght was come he was there himsilf alone.
040	MAT	014	024	And the shippe was now in the middes of the see and was toost with waves for it was a cotrary wynde.
040	MAT	014	025	In the fourthe watche of ye night Iesus came vnto them walkynge on the see.
040	MAT	014	026	And when his disciples sawe him walkynge on the see they were troubled sayinge: it is some spirite and cryed out for feare.
040	MAT	014	027	And streyght waye Iesus spake vnto them sayinge: be of god cheare it is I be not afrayed.
040	MAT	014	028	Peter answered him and sayde: master if thou be he bid me come vnto the on the water.
040	MAT	014	029	And he sayde come.  And when Peter was come doune out of ye shippe he walked on ye water to go to Iesus.
040	MAT	014	030	But when he sawe a myghty wynde he was afrayed.  And as he beganne to synke he cryed sayinge: master save me.
040	MAT	014	031	And immediatly Iesus stretched forth his hode and caught him and sayde to him: O thou of lytell faith wherfore diddest thou dout?
040	MAT	014	032	And assone as they were come in to ye shippe ye wynde ceassed.
040	MAT	014	033	Then they that were in the shippe came and worshipped him sayinge: of a truth thou arte ye sonne of God.
040	MAT	014	034	And when they were come over they went in to ye londe of Genazareth.
040	MAT	014	035	And when ye men of yt place had knowledge of him they sent out in to all yt countre rounde about and brought vnto him all that were sicke
040	MAT	014	036	and besought him that they myght touche the hemme of his vesture only.  And as many as touched it were made safe.
040	MAT	015	001	Then came to Iesus scribes and pharises from Ierusalem sayinge:
040	MAT	015	002	why do thy disciples transgresse the tradicios of ye elders?  for they wesshe not their hondes when they eate breed.
040	MAT	015	003	He answered and sayde vnto them: why do ye also transgresse ye comaundment of God thorowe youre tradicions?
040	MAT	015	004	For God comaunded sayinge: honoure thy father and mother and he that cursseth father or mother shall suffer deeth.
040	MAT	015	005	But ye saye every ma shall saye to his father or mother: That which thou desyrest of me to helpe ye with: is geven God:
040	MAT	015	006	and so shall he not honoure his father or his mother.  And thus haue ye made yt the comaundment of God is with out effecte through youre tradicios.
040	MAT	015	007	Ypocrites well prophesyed of you Esay sayinge:
040	MAT	015	008	This people draweth nye vnto me with their mouthes and honoureth me with their lippes howbe it their hertes are farre from me:
040	MAT	015	009	but in vayne they worshippe me teachinge doctrines whiche are nothing but mens precepts.
040	MAT	015	010	And he called the people vnto him and sayde to them: heare and vnderstande.
040	MAT	015	011	That which goeth into the mouth defyleth not ye man: but that which commeth out of the mouth defyleth the man.
040	MAT	015	012	Then came his disciples and sayde vnto him.  Perceavest thou not how that the pharises are offended in hearinge thys sayinge?
040	MAT	015	013	He answered and sayde: all plantes which my hevely father hath not planted shalbe plucked vp by the rotes.
040	MAT	015	014	Let them alone they be the blynde leaders of the blynde.  If the blynde leede the blynde boothe shall fall into the dyche.
040	MAT	015	015	Then answered Peter and sayd to him: declare vnto vs this parable.
040	MAT	015	016	Then sayde Iesus: are ye yet with oute vnderstondinge?
040	MAT	015	017	perceave ye not that what soever goeth in at the mouth descendeth doune in to the bely and is cast out into the draught?
040	MAT	015	018	But those thingis which procede out of the mouth come from the herte and they defyle the man.
040	MAT	015	019	For out of the herte come evyll thoughtis murder breakyng of wedlocke whordo theefte falce witnes berynge blasphemye.
040	MAT	015	020	These are the thingis which defyle a man.  But to eate with vnwesshen hondes defyleth not a man.
040	MAT	015	021	And Iesus went thence and departed in to the costis of Tyre and Sidon.
040	MAT	015	022	And beholde a woman which was a Cananite came out of ye same coostis and cryed vnto him sayinge: have mercy on me Lorde the sonne of David my doughter is pytiously vexed with a devyll.
040	MAT	015	023	And he gave her never a worde to answer.  Then came to him his disciples and besought him sayinge: sende her awaye for she foloweth vs cryinge.
040	MAT	015	024	He answered and sayde: I am not sent but vnto ye loost shepe of ye housse of Israel.
040	MAT	015	025	Then she came and worshipped him sayinge: master helpe me.
040	MAT	015	026	He answered and sayde: it is not good to take the chyldrens breed and to cast it to whelpes.
040	MAT	015	027	She answered and sayde: truthe Lorde: neverthelesse the whelpes eate of the cromes which fall from their masters table.
040	MAT	015	028	Then Iesus answered and sayde vnto her.  O woman greate is thy faith be it to the even as thou desyrest.  And her doughter was made whole even at that same houre.
040	MAT	015	029	Then Iesus went awaye from thence and came nye vnto the see of Galile and went vp in to a mountayne and sat doune there.
040	MAT	015	030	And moche people came vnto him havinge with the halt blynde domme maymed and other many: and cast them doune at Iesus fete.  And he healed them
040	MAT	015	031	in so moche that the people wondred to se the dome speake the maymed whole the halt to go and ye blynde to se.  And they glorified the God of Israel.
040	MAT	015	032	Then Iesus called his disciples to him and sayde: I have compassion on ye people becau se they have cotynued with me now. iii.  dayes and have nought to eate: and I wyll not let them departe fastinge leste they perisshe in ye waye.
040	MAT	015	033	And his disciples sayd vnto him: whece shuld we get so moche breed in ye wildernes as shuld suffise so greate a multitude?
040	MAT	015	034	And Iesus sayde vnto them: how many loves have ye?  And they sayde: seven and a feawe litle fysshes.
040	MAT	015	035	And he comaunded ye people to syt doune on ye grounde:
040	MAT	015	036	and toke the seven loves and the fysshes and gave thankes and brake them and gave to his disciples and the disciples gave them to the people.
040	MAT	015	037	And they dyd all eate and were suffised.  And they toke vp of the broke meate that was lefte. vii.  basketes full.
040	MAT	015	038	And yet they that ate were. iiii.  M.  men besyde wemen and chyldren.
040	MAT	015	039	And he sent awaye the people and toke shippe and came into the parties of Magdala.
040	MAT	016	001	Then came the pharises and saduces and did tempte him desyringe him to shewe them some signe from heve.
040	MAT	016	002	He answered and sayde vnto the.  At even ye saye we shall have fayre wedder and yt because ye skye is reed:
040	MAT	016	003	and in the morninge ye saye to daye shalbe foule wedder and that because the skye is cloudy and reed.  O ye ypocrites ye can discerne ye fassion of the skye: and can ye not discerne ye signes of the tymes?
040	MAT	016	004	The frowarde nacion and advoutrous seketh a signe and there shall non other signe be geven vnto them but the signe of the prophet Ionas.  So lefte he them and departed.
040	MAT	016	005	And when his disciples were come to the other side of the water they had forgotte to take breed with the.
040	MAT	016	006	Then Iesus sayd vnto them: Take hede and beware of the leve of ye Pharises and of ye Saduces.
040	MAT	016	007	And they thought in them selves sayinge: because we have brought no breed with vs.
040	MAT	016	008	When Iesus vnderstode that he sayd vnto the.  O ye of lytell faith why are youre mindes cumbred because ye have brought no breed?
040	MAT	016	009	Do ye not yet perceave nether remeber those. v.  loves when there were. v.  M.  men and how many baskettes toke ye vp?
040	MAT	016	010	Nether the. vii.  loves when there were. iiiii.  M.  and how many baskettes toke ye vp?
040	MAT	016	011	Why perceave ye not then yt I spake not vnto you of breed whe I sayde beware of the leven of the Pharises and of the Saduces?
040	MAT	016	012	The vnderstode they how that he bad not them beware of the leven of breed: but of the doctrine of the Pharises and of the Saduces.
040	MAT	016	013	When Iesus cam in to the costes of the cite which is called Cesarea Philippi he axed his disciples sayinge: whom do men saye yt I the sonne of ma am?
040	MAT	016	014	They saide some saye yt thou arte Ihon Baptist some Helias some Ieremias or one of ye prophetes.
040	MAT	016	015	He sayde vnto the: but who saye ye yt I am?
040	MAT	016	016	Simo Peter answered and sayde: Thou arte Christ ye sonne of the lyvinge God.
040	MAT	016	017	And Iesus answered and sayde to him: happy arte thou Simon the sonne of Ionas for fleshe and bloud hath not opened vnto the yt but my father which is in heve.
040	MAT	016	018	And I saye also vnto the yt thou arte Peter: and apon this rocke I wyll bylde my congregacion.  And the gates of hell shall not prevayle ageynst it.
040	MAT	016	019	And I wyll geve vnto the the keyes of the kyngdom of heven: and whatsoever thou byndest vpon erth shall be bounde in heven: and whatsoever thou lowsest on erthe shalbe lowsed in heven.
040	MAT	016	020	Then he charged his disciples yt they shulde tell no man yt he was Iesus Christ.
040	MAT	016	021	From yt tyme forth Iesus began to shewe vnto his disciples how yt he must go vnto Ierusalem and suffer many thinges of ye Elders and of ye hye prestes and of the scribes and must be killed and ryse agayne ye thirde daye.
040	MAT	016	022	But Peter toke him asyde and began to rebuke him sayinge: master faver thy sylfe this shall not come vnto the.
040	MAT	016	023	Then tourned he aboute and sayde vnto Peter: come after me Satan thou offendest me because thou sauourest not godly thinges but wordly thinges
040	MAT	016	024	Iesus then sayde to his disciples.  If eny man wyll folowe me leet him forsake him sylfe and take vp his crosse and folowe me.
040	MAT	016	025	For who soever wyll save his lyfe shall loose it.  And whosoever shall loose his lyfe for my sake shall fynde it.
040	MAT	016	026	What shall it proffet a man though he shulde wynne all the whoole worlde: yf he loose his owne soule?  Or els what shall a man geve to redeme his soule agayne with all?
040	MAT	016	027	For the sonne of man shall come in the glory of his father wt his angels: and then shall he rewarde every man accordinge to his dedes.
040	MAT	016	028	Verely I saye vnto you some ther be amonge them that here stonde which shall not taste of deeth tyll they shall have sene the sonne of man come in his kyngdomen.
040	MAT	017	001	And after.  vi.  dayes Iesus toke Peter and Iames and Ihon his brother and brought them vp into an hye mountayne out of the waye
040	MAT	017	002	and was transfygured before them: and his face did shyne as the sunne and his clothes were as whyte as the light.
040	MAT	017	003	And beholde ther appered vnto the Moses and Helyas talkinge with him.
040	MAT	017	004	Then answered Peter and sayde to Iesus: master here is good beinge for vs.  If thou wylt leet vs make here. iii.  tabernacles one for the and one for Moses and one for Helyas.
040	MAT	017	005	Whyll he yet spake beholde a bright cloude shadowed them.  And beholde there came a voyce out of ye cloude sayinge: this is my deare sonne in whom I delite heare him.
040	MAT	017	006	And when the disciples hearde that they fell on their faces and were soore afrayed.
040	MAT	017	007	And Iesus came and touched them and sayde: aryse and be not afrayed.
040	MAT	017	008	And when they looked vp they saw no man saue Iesus onely.
040	MAT	017	009	And as they came doune from the mountayne Iesus charged them sayinge: se yt ye shewe the vision to no man vntyll the sonne of man be rysen ageyne from deeth.
040	MAT	017	010	And his disciples axed of him sayinge: Why then saye the scribes yt Helyas muste fyrst come?
040	MAT	017	011	Iesus answered and sayd vnto them: Helyas shall fyrst come and restore all thinges.
040	MAT	017	012	And I saye vnto you yt Helyas is come alredy and they knewe him not: but have done vnto him whatsoever they lusted.  In lyke wyse shall also the sonne of man suffre of the.
040	MAT	017	013	Then ye disciples perceaved that he spake vnto them of Ihon baptist.
040	MAT	017	014	And when they were come to ye people ther cam to him a certayne man and kneled doune to him and sayde:
040	MAT	017	015	Master have mercy on my sonne for he is franticke: and is sore vexed.  And oft tymes he falleth into the fyre and oft into ye water
040	MAT	017	016	And I brought him to thy disciples and they coulde not heale him.
040	MAT	017	017	Iesus answered and sayde: O generacion faythles and croked: how longe shall I be with you?  how longe shall I suffre you?  bring him hidder to me.
040	MAT	017	018	And Iesus rebuked the devyll and he ca out of him.  And ye child was healed even yt same houre.
040	MAT	017	019	Then came the disciples to Iesus secretly and sayde: Why could not we cast him out?
040	MAT	017	020	Iesus sayd vnto the: Because of youre vnbelefe For I saye veryly vnto you: yf ye had faythe as a grayne of musterd seed ye shuld saye vnto this moutayne remove hence to yonder place and he shuld remove: nether shuld eny thinge be vnpossible for you to do.
040	MAT	017	021	How be it this kynde goeth not oute but by prayer and fastinge.
040	MAT	017	022	As they passed the tyme in Galile Iesus sayde vnto them: the sonne of man shalbe betrayed into the hondes of men
040	MAT	017	023	and they shall kill him and the thyrd daye he shall ryse agayne.  And they sorowed greatly.
040	MAT	017	024	And when they were come to Capernau they yt were wont to gadre poll money came to Peter and sayde: Doth youre master paye tribute?
040	MAT	017	025	He sayd: ye.  And when he was come into the house Iesus spake fyrst to him saying What thinkest thou Simon?  of whome do ye kynges of the erth take tribute or poll money?  of their chyldren or of straungers?
040	MAT	017	026	Peter sayde vnto him: of straungers.  Then sayd Iesus vnto him agayne: Then are the chyldren fre.
040	MAT	017	027	Neverthelesse lest we shuld offende the: goo to ye see and cast in thyne angle and take the fysshe yt fyrst cometh vp: and when thou hast opened his mouthe thou shalt fynde a pece of twentie pence: yt take and paye for me and the.
040	MAT	018	001	The same tyme the disciples came vnto Iesus saying: who is ye greatest in the kyngdome of heve?
040	MAT	018	002	Iesus called a chylde vnto him and set him in the middes of them:
040	MAT	018	003	and sayd.  Verely I say vnto you: except ye tourne and become as chyldren ye cannot enter into the kyngdom of heven.
040	MAT	018	004	Whosoever therfore humble him sylfe as this chylde the same is the greatest in ye kyngdome of heve.
040	MAT	018	005	And who soever receaveth suche a chylde in my name receaveth me.
040	MAT	018	006	But whosoever offende one of these lytelons which beleve in me: it were better for him that a milstone were hanged aboute his necke and that he were drouned in the depth of the see.
040	MAT	018	007	Wo be vnto the world because of offences.  How be it it cannot be avoided but yt offences shalbe geven.  Neverthelesse woo be to ye man by who the offence cometh.
040	MAT	018	008	Wherfore yf thy honde or thy fote offende the cut him of and cast him from the.  It ys better for the to enter into lyfe halt or maymed rather then thou shuldest havinge two hondes or two fete be cast into everlasting fyre.
040	MAT	018	009	And yf also thyne eye offende the plucke him oute and caste him from the.  It is better for the to enter into lyfe with one eye then havyng two eyes to be cast into hell fyre.
040	MAT	018	010	Se that ye despise not one of these litelons.  For I saye vnto you yt in heven their angels alwayes behold the face of my father which is in heven.
040	MAT	018	011	Ye and the sonne of man is come to saue that which is lost.
040	MAT	018	012	How thinke ye?  Yf a man have an hondred shepe and one of them be gone astray dothe he not leve nynty and nyne in ye moutains and go and seke that one which is gone astray?
040	MAT	018	013	If it happen that he fynd him veryly I say vnto you: he reioyseth more of that shepe then of the nynty and nyne which went not astray.
040	MAT	018	014	Even so it is not the wyll of youre father in heven that one of these lytelons shulde perishe.
040	MAT	018	015	Moreover yf thy brother treaspace agenst the.  Go and tell him his faute betwene him and the alone.  Yf he heare the thou hast wone thy brother:
040	MAT	018	016	But yf he heare the not then take yet with the one or two that in the mouth of two or thre witnesses all thinges maye be stablisshed.
040	MAT	018	017	If he heare not them tell it vnto the congregacion.  If he heare not ye congregacion take him as an hethen man and as a publican.
040	MAT	018	018	Verely I say vnto you what soever ye bynde on erth shalbe bounde in heven.  And what soever ye lowse on erth shalbe lowsed in heven.
040	MAT	018	019	Agayn I say vnto you that yf two of you shall agre in erth apon eny maner thynge what soever they shall desyre: it shalbe geven them of my father which is in heven.
040	MAT	018	020	For where two or thre are gathered togedder in my name there am I in the myddes of them.
040	MAT	018	021	Then came Peter to him and sayde: master howe ofte shall I forgeve my brother yf he synne agaynst me seven tymes?
040	MAT	018	022	Iesus sayd vnto him: I saye not vnto the seven tymes: but seventy tymes seven tymes.
040	MAT	018	023	Therfore is ye kingdome of heven lykened vnto a certayne kynge which wolde take a countis of his servauntis.
040	MAT	018	024	And when he had begone to recken one was broughte vnto him whiche ought him ten thousande talentis:
040	MAT	018	025	whome be cause he had nought to paye his master commaunded him to be solde and his wyfe and his chyldren and all that he had and payment to be made.
040	MAT	018	026	The servaunt fell doune and besought him sayinge: Sir geve me respyte and I wyll paye it every whit.
040	MAT	018	027	Then had the Lorde pytie on that servaunt and lowsed him and forgave him the det.
040	MAT	018	028	And ye sayde servaut wet oute and founde one of his felowes which ought him an hundred pence and leyed hondes on him and toke him by the throote sayinge: paye me yt thou owest.
040	MAT	018	029	And his felowe fell doune and besought him sayinge: have pacience with me and I wyll paye the all.
040	MAT	018	030	And he wolde not but went and cast him into preson tyll he shulde paye the det.
040	MAT	018	031	When his other felowes sawe what was done they were very sory and came and tolde vnto their lorde all yt had happened.
040	MAT	018	032	Then his lorde called him and sayde vnto him.  O evyll servaut I forgave the all that det because thou prayedst me: was it not mete also yt thou
040	MAT	018	033	shuldest have had copassion on thy felow even as I had pitie on ye?
040	MAT	018	034	And his lorde was wrooth and delyuered him to the iaylers tyll he shnld paye all that was due to him.
040	MAT	018	035	So lyke wyse shall my hevenly father do vnto you except ye forgeve with youre hertes eache one to his brother their treaspases.
040	MAT	019	001	And it came to passe when Iesus had fynisshed those sayinges he gat him from Galile and came into the coostes of Iewry beyonde Iordan
040	MAT	019	002	and moche people folowed him and he healed them theare.
040	MAT	019	003	Then came vnto him the pharises temtinge him and sayinge to him: Ys it lawfull for a man to put awaye his wyfe for all maner of causes?
040	MAT	019	004	He answered and sayd vnto them: Have ye not redde how that he which made man at the beginninge made them man and woman
040	MAT	019	005	and sayde: for this thinge shall a ma leve father and mother and cleve vnto his wyfe and they twayne shalbe one flesshe.
040	MAT	019	006	Wherfore now are they not twayne but one flesshe.  Let not man therfore put a sunder that which God hath cuppled to gedder.
040	MAT	019	007	The sayde they to him: why did Moses comaunde to geve a testimoniall of divorsemet and to put hyr awaye?
040	MAT	019	008	He sayde vnto them: Moses because of the hardnes of youre hertes suffred you to put awaye youre wyfes: But from ye beginnynge it was not so.
040	MAT	019	009	I saye therfore vnto you whosoever putteth awaye his wyfe (except it be for fornicacion) and maryeth another breaketh wedlocke.  And whosoever maryeth her which is divorsed doeth commyt advoutry.
040	MAT	019	010	Then sayde his disciples to him: yf the mater be so betwene man and wyfe then is it not good to mary.
040	MAT	019	011	He sayde vnto them: all me can not awaye with that sayinge save they to whom it is geve.
040	MAT	019	012	Ther are chaste which were so borne out of their mothers belly.  And ther are chaste which be made of men.  And ther be chaste which have made them selves chaste for the kyngdome of heves sake.  He that can take it let him take it.
040	MAT	019	013	Then were brought to him yonge chyldre that he shuld put his hondes on them and praye And the disciples rebuked them.
040	MAT	019	014	But Iesus sayde: suffre the chyldren and forbid them not to come to me: for of suche is the kyngdome of heven.
040	MAT	019	015	And when he had put his hondes on them he departed thence.
040	MAT	019	016	And beholde one came and sayde vnto him: good master what good thinge shall I do that I maye have eternall lyfe?
040	MAT	019	017	He sayde vnto him: why callest thou me good?  there is none good but one and that is God.  But yf thou wylt entre in to lyfe kepe the commaundementes.
040	MAT	019	018	The other sayde to him Which?  And Iesus sayde: breake no wedloke kill not steale not: beare not falce witnes:
040	MAT	019	019	honoure father and mother: and love thyne neighbour as thy sylfe.
040	MAT	019	020	And the younge man sayde vnto him: I have observed all these thingis from my youth what lacke I yet?
040	MAT	019	021	And Iesus sayde vnto him yf thou wylt be perfecte goo and sell that thou hast and geve it to the povre and thou shalt have treasure in heven and come and folowe me.
040	MAT	019	022	When ye younge ma hearde yt sayinge he wet awaye mourninge.  For he had greate possessions.
040	MAT	019	023	Then Iesus sayde vnto his disciples: Verely I saye vnto you: yt is harde for a ryche ma to enter into ye kyngdome of heaven.
040	MAT	019	024	And moreover I saye vnto you: it is easier for a camell to go through the eye of a nedle then for a ryche man to enter into the kyngdome of God.
040	MAT	019	025	When his disciples hearde that they were excedingly amased sayinge: who then can be saved?
040	MAT	019	026	Iesus behelde the and sayde vnto them: with men this is vnpossible but with God all thinges are possible.
040	MAT	019	027	Then answered Peter and sayde to him: Beholde we have forsaken all and folowed the what shall we have?
040	MAT	019	028	Iesus sayde vnto them: verely I saye to you: when the sonne of man shall syt in ye seate of his maieste ye which folowe me in ye seconde generacion shall syt also vpon. xii.  seates and iudge ye. xii.  tribes of Israel.
040	MAT	019	029	And whosoever forsaketh housses or brethren or systers other father or mother or wyfe or chyldren or landes for my names sake ye same shall receave an hundred folde and shall inheret everlastynge lyfe.
040	MAT	019	030	Many that are fyrste shalbe laste and the laste shalbe fyrste.
040	MAT	020	001	For the kyngdome of heven ys lyke vnto an houssholder which went out erly in the morninge to hyre labourers into hys vyneyarde.
040	MAT	020	002	And he agreed wt the labourers for a peny a daye and sent them into his vyneyarde.
040	MAT	020	003	And he went out about the thyrde houre and sawe other stonding ydell in the marketplace
040	MAT	020	004	and sayd vnto them go ye also into my vyneyarde: and whatsoever is right I will geve you.  And they went there waye.
040	MAT	020	005	Agayne he wet out about the sixte and nynthe houre and dyd lyke wyse.
040	MAT	020	006	And he went out aboute the eleventhe houre and founde other stondynge ydell and sayde vnto them: Why stonde ye here all the daye ydell?
040	MAT	020	007	They sayde vnto hym: because no man hath hyred vs.  He sayde to them: goo ye alsoo into my vyneyarde and whatsoever is right that shall ye receave.
040	MAT	020	008	When even was come the lorde of the vyneyarde sayde vnto hys steward: call the labourers and geve them their hyre beginnyng at ye laste tyll thou come to ye fyrste.
040	MAT	020	009	And they whiche were hyred aboute the eleventhe houre came and receaved every man a peny.
040	MAT	020	010	Then came ye fyrst supposyng yt they shuld receave moare: and they likewyse receaved every man a peny.
040	MAT	020	011	And when they had receaved it they murmured agaynst the good man of the housse
040	MAT	020	012	saying: These laste have wrought but one houre and thou hast made them equall vnto vs which have born ye burthe and heet of the daye.
040	MAT	020	013	He answered to one of the sayinge: frende I do the no wronge: dyddest thou not agre wt me for a peny?
040	MAT	020	014	Take that which is thy duty and go thy waye.  I will geve vnto this last as moche as to the.
040	MAT	020	015	Ys it not lawfull for me to do as me listeth with myne awne?  Ys thyne eye evyll because I am good?
040	MAT	020	016	Soo the laste shalbe fyrste and the fyrste shalbe laste.  For many are called and feawe be chosen.
040	MAT	020	017	And Iesus ascended to Ierusalem and toke the. xii.  disciples a parte in the waye and sayde to the.
040	MAT	020	018	Beholde we goo vp to Ierusalem and the sonne of ma shalbe betrayed vnto ye chefe prestes and vnto the scribes and they shall condene him to deeth
040	MAT	020	019	and shall delyvre him to the getils to be mocked to be scourged and to be crucified: and ye thyrd daye he shall ryse agayne.
040	MAT	020	020	Then came to hym the mother of zebedes chyldren with her sonnes worshippynge him and desyringe a certayne thinge of him.
040	MAT	020	021	And he sayd vnto her: what wilt thou have?  She sayde vnto him: Gravnte that these my two sonnes may sit ye one on thy right hond and the other on ye lifte hond in thy kyngdome.
040	MAT	020	022	Iesus answered and sayd: Ye wot not what ye axe.  Are ye able to drynke of the cuppe yt I shall drynke of and to be baptised wt the baptyme that I shalbe baptised with?  They answered to him that we are.
040	MAT	020	023	And he sayd vnto the: Ye shall drinke of my cvp and shalbe baptised with the baptyme that I shalbe baptised with.  But to syt on my ryght hond and on my lyst hond is not myne to geve: but to them for whom it is prepared of my father.
040	MAT	020	024	And when the ten hearde this they disdayned at ye two brethre:
040	MAT	020	025	But Iesus called them vnto him and sayde: Ye knowe yt the lordes of the gentyls have dominacio over them.  And they that are great exercise power over the.
040	MAT	020	026	It shall not be so amoge you.  But whosoever wyll be greate amoge you let him be youre minister:
040	MAT	020	027	and whosoever wil be chefe let him be youre servaut
040	MAT	020	028	eve as the sonne of man came not to be ministred vnto but to minister and to geve his lyfe for the redempcion of many.
040	MAT	020	029	And as they departed fro Hierico moche people folowed him.
040	MAT	020	030	And beholde two blinde men sittinge by ye waysyde whe they hearde Iesus passe by cryed sayinge: Thou Lorde ye sonne of David have mercy on vs.
040	MAT	020	031	And ye people rebuked them be cause they shulde holde their peace.  But they cryed ye moare sayinge: have mercy on vs thou Lorde which arte ye sonne of David.
040	MAT	020	032	Then Iesus stode styll and called the and sayde: what will ye that I shulde do to you:
040	MAT	020	033	They sayd to him: Lorde that oure eyes maye be opened.
040	MAT	020	034	Iesus had copassion on the and touched their eyes.  And immediatly their eyes receaved syght.  And they folowed him.
040	MAT	021	001	When they drewe neye vnto Ierusalem and were come to Betphage vnto mounte olivete: then sent Iesus two of his disciples
040	MAT	021	002	saiynge to the.  Go in to the toune that lyeth over agaynste you and anone ye shall fynde an asse bounde and her colte with her: lose them and bringe them vnto me.
040	MAT	021	003	And if eny man saye ought vnto you saye ye yt the lorde hath neade of them: and streyght waye he will let them go.
040	MAT	021	004	All this was done to fulfyll that which was spoken by the Prophet sayinge:
040	MAT	021	005	Tell ye the doughter of Sion: beholde thy kynge cometh vnto the meke and sittinge vpon an asse and a colte the fole of an asse vsed to the yooke.
040	MAT	021	006	The disciples went and dyd as Iesus comaunded them
040	MAT	021	007	and brought ye asse and the colte and put on them their clothes and set him theron.
040	MAT	021	008	And many of the people spreed their garmentes in ye waye.  Other cut doune braunches fro the trees and strawed them in the waye.
040	MAT	021	009	Moreover the people that went before and they also that came after cryed sayinge: Hosanna to ye sonne of David.  Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the Lorde Hosanna in the hyest.
040	MAT	021	010	And when he was come in to Ierusalem all the cyte was moved sayinge: who is this?
040	MAT	021	011	And the people sayde: this is Iesus the Prophet of Nazareth a cyte of Galile.
040	MAT	021	012	And Iesus went in to the temple of God and cast out all them that soulde and bought in the temple and overthrew the tables of the mony chaugers and the seates of them that solde doves
040	MAT	021	013	and sayde to them: It is wrytten my housse shalbe called the housse of prayer.  But ye have made it a denne of theves.
040	MAT	021	014	And the blinde and the halt came to him in ye teple and he healed the.
040	MAT	021	015	When the chefe prestes and scribes sawe the marveylles that he dyd and the chyldren cryinge in the teple and sayinge Hosanna to the sonne of David they disdayned
040	MAT	021	016	and sayde vnto him: hearest thou what these saye?  Iesus sayde vnto them yee: have ye never redde of the mouth of babes and suckelinges thou haste ordeyned prayse?
040	MAT	021	017	And he lefte the and wet out of ye cite vnto Bethanie and had his abydige there.
040	MAT	021	018	In the mornynge as he returned in to the cyte ageyne he hungred
040	MAT	021	019	and spyed a fygge trre in the waye and came to it and founde nothinge theron but leves only and sayd to it never frute growe on the hence forwardes.  And ano the fygge tree wyddered awaye.
040	MAT	021	020	And when his disciples sawe that they marveled sayinge: Howe sone is the fygge tree wyddered awaye?
040	MAT	021	021	Iesus answered and sayde vnto the: Verely I saye vnto you yf ye shall have faith and shall not dout ye shall not only do that which I have done to the fygge tree: but also yf ye shall saye vnto this moutayne take thy silfe awaye and cast thy silfe into the see it shalbe done.
040	MAT	021	022	And whatsoever ye shall axe in prayer (if ye beleve) ye shall receave it.
040	MAT	021	023	And when he was come into the teple the chefe prestes and the elders of the people came vnto him as he was teachinge and sayde: by what auctorite doest thou these thinges?  and who gave the this power?
040	MAT	021	024	Iesus answered and sayde vnto them: I also will axe of you a certayne question which if ye assoyle me I in lyke wyse wyll tell you by what auctorite I do these thinges.
040	MAT	021	025	The baptime of Iohn: whence was it?  fro heve or of men?  Then they reasoned amoge them selves sayinge: yf we shall saye fro heven he will saye vnto vs: why dyd ye not then beleve hym?
040	MAT	021	026	But and if we shall saye of men then feare we the people.  For all men helde Iohn as a Prophet.
040	MAT	021	027	And they answered Iesus and sayde: we cannot tell.  And he lyke wyse sayd vnto them: nether tell I you by what auctorite I do these thinges.
040	MAT	021	028	What saye ye to this?  A certayne man had two sonnes and came to ye elder and sayde: sonne go and worke to daye in my vineyarde.
040	MAT	021	029	He answered and sayde I will not: but afterwarde repented and went.
040	MAT	021	030	Then came he to the second and sayde lyke wyse.  And he answered and sayde: I will syr: yet wet not.
040	MAT	021	031	Whether of the twayne dyd the will of the father?  And they sayde vnto hym: the fyrst.  Iesus sayde vnto the: verely I saye vnto you that the publicans and the harlotes shall come into ye kyngdome of God before you.
040	MAT	021	032	For Iohn came vnto you in the waye of rightewesnes and ye beleved hym not.  But the publicans and the harlotes beleved him.  And yet ye (though ye sawe it) were not yet moved with repentaunce that ye myght afterwarde have beleved hym.
040	MAT	021	033	Herken another similitude.  Ther was a certayne housholder which planted a vineyarde and hedged it roude about and made a wynpresse in it and bilt a tower and let it out to husbandmen and wet in to a straunge coutre.
040	MAT	021	034	And when the tyme of the frute drewe neare he sent his servauntes to the husbandmen to receave the frutes of it.
040	MAT	021	035	And ye husbandme caught his servauntes and bet one kylled another and stoned another.
040	MAT	021	036	Agayne he sent other servantes moo then the fyrst: and they served them lyke wyse.
040	MAT	021	037	But last of all he sent vnto the his awne sonne sayinge: they will feare my sonne.
040	MAT	021	038	But when the husbandmen sawe the sonne they sayde amoge the selves: This is the heyre: come let vs kyll him and let vs take his inheritaunce to oure selves.
040	MAT	021	039	And they caught him and thrust him out of the vineyarde and slewe him.
040	MAT	021	040	When the lorde of the vyneyarde commeth what will he do wt those husbandme?
040	MAT	021	041	They sayde vnto him: he will cruellye destroye those evyll persons and wyll let out his vyneyarde vnto other husbandmen which shall delyver him the frute at tymes convenient
040	MAT	021	042	Iesus sayde vnto the: dyd ye never redde in the scriptures?  The stone which ye bylders refused ye same is set in ye principall parte of ye corner: this was the lordes doinge and yt is mervelous in oure eyes.
040	MAT	021	043	Therfore saye I vnto you the kyngdome of God shalbe take from you and shalbe geve to the getyls which shall brynge forth the frutes of it.
040	MAT	021	044	And whosoever shall fall on this stone he shalbe broken but on whosoever it shall fall vpon it will grynde him to powder.
040	MAT	021	045	And when the chefe prestes and Pharises hearde these similitudes they perceaved yt he spake of the.
040	MAT	021	046	And they wet about to laye hondes on him but they feared ye people because they tooke him as a Prophet.
040	MAT	022	001	And Iesus answered and spake vnto them agayne in similitudes sayinge.
040	MAT	022	002	The kingdome of heve is lyke vnto a certayne kynge which maryed his sonne
040	MAT	022	003	and sent forth his servantes to call them that were byd to the weddinge and they wolde not come.
040	MAT	022	004	Ageyne he sent forth other servauntes sayinge: Tell them which are bydden: beholde I have prepared my dynner myne oxen and my fatlinges are kylled and all thinges are redy come vnto the mariage.
040	MAT	022	005	But they made light of it and went their wayes: one to his ferme place another about his marchaundise
040	MAT	022	006	the remnaunt toke his seruantes and intreated them vngodly and slewe them.
040	MAT	022	007	When the kinge hearde that he was wroth and send forth his warryers and distroyed those murtherers and brent vp their cyte.
040	MAT	022	008	Then sayde he to his servauutes: the weddinge was prepared.  But they which were bydden were not worthy.
040	MAT	022	009	Go ye therfore out into ye hyewayes and as many as ye finde byd them to the mariage.
040	MAT	022	010	The seruauntes wet out into the hiewayes and gaddered to gedder as many as they coulde fynde both good and bad and ye weddinge was furnysshed with gestes.
040	MAT	022	011	Then the kynge came in to viset the gestes and spyed there a ma which had not on a weddinge garment
040	MAT	022	012	and sayde vnto him: frende how fortuned it that thou camest in hither and hast not on a weddyng garment?  And he was eve spechlesse.
040	MAT	022	013	Then sayde the kynge to his ministers: take and bynde hym hand and fote and caste hym into vtter darcknes there shalbe wepinge and gnasshinge of teth.
040	MAT	022	014	For many are called and feawe be chosen.
040	MAT	022	015	Then wet the Pharises and toke counsell how they might tagle him in his wordes.
040	MAT	022	016	And they sent vnto him their disciples with Herodes servauntes sayinge: Master we knowe yt thou are true and teachest the waye of god trulie nether carest for eny man for thou consydrest not menes estate.
040	MAT	022	017	Tell vs therfore: how thynkest thou?  Is it lawfull to geve tribute vnto Cesar or not?
040	MAT	022	018	Iesus perceaved their wikednes and sayde: Why tempte ye me ye ypocrites?
040	MAT	022	019	Let me se ye tribute money.  And they toke hym a peny.
040	MAT	022	020	And he sayde vnto them: whose is this ymage and superscripcion?
040	MAT	022	021	They sayde vnto him: Cesars.  Then sayde he vnto them.  Geve therfore to Cesar that which is Cesars: and geve vnto god that which is goddes.
040	MAT	022	022	When they hearde that they marveled and lefte hym and went there waye.
040	MAT	022	023	The same daye the Saduces came to him (which saye that there is no resurrcecion) and axed him
040	MAT	022	024	sayinge: Master Moses bade yf a man dye havinge no chyldre that the brother mary his wyfe and reyse vp seed vnto his brother.
040	MAT	022	025	Ther were wt vs seven brethre and the fyrste maried and deceased wt oute yssue and lefte his wyfe vnto his brother.
040	MAT	022	026	Lykewise the seconde and ye thryd vnto the sevethe.
040	MAT	022	027	Laste of all the woman dyed also.
040	MAT	022	028	Now in the resurreccion whose wyfe shall she be of the seven?  For all had her.
040	MAT	022	029	Iesus answered and sayde vnto the: ye are deceaved and vnderstonde not the scriptures nor yet the power of God.
040	MAT	022	030	For in the resurreccion they nether mary nor are maryed: but are as the angels of God in heven.
040	MAT	022	031	As touchynge the resurreccion of the deed: have ye not redde what is sayde vnto you of God which sayeth:
040	MAT	022	032	I am Abrahams God and Ysaacks God and the God of Iacob?  God is not the God of the deed: but of the lyvinge.
040	MAT	022	033	And when the people hearde that they were astonyed at his doctrine.
040	MAT	022	034	When the Pharises had hearde how yt he had put the Saduces to silence they drewe to gedder
040	MAT	022	035	and one of them which was a doctoure of lawe axed a question teptinge h m and sayinge:
040	MAT	022	036	Master which is ye chefe comaundment in the lawe?
040	MAT	022	037	Iesus sayde vnto him: love the Lorde thy God wt all thine herte with all thy soule and with all thy mynde.
040	MAT	022	038	This is the fyrst and the chefe comaundement.
040	MAT	022	039	And ther is another lyke vnto this.  Love thyne neghbour as thy selfe.
040	MAT	022	040	In these two commaundemetes hange all the lawe and the Prophetes.
040	MAT	022	041	Whyll the Pharises were gaddered togeder Iesus axed
040	MAT	022	042	the sayinge: what thinke ye of Christ?  Whose sonne is he?  They sayde vnto him: the sonne of David.
040	MAT	022	043	He sayde vnto the: how then doeth David in spirite call him Lorde sayinge?
040	MAT	022	044	The Lorde sayde to my Lorde syt on my right honde: tyll I make thyne enemyes thy fote stole.
040	MAT	022	045	Yf David call him Lorde: how is he then his sonne?
040	MAT	022	046	And none coulde answere him ageyne one worde: nether dueste eny from that daye forth axe him eny moo questions.
040	MAT	023	001	Then spake Iesus to the people and to his disciples
040	MAT	023	002	sayinge.  The Scribes and the Pharises sit in Moses seate.
040	MAT	023	003	All therfore whatsoever they byd you observe that observe and do: but after their workes do not:
040	MAT	023	004	For they saye and do not.  Ye and they bynde hevy burthes and grevous to be borne and ley the on menes shulders: but they themsylfes will not heave at them with one of their fyngers.
040	MAT	023	005	All their workes they do for to be sene of me.  They set abroade their philateries and make large borders on there garmetes
040	MAT	023	006	and love to sit vppermooste at feastes and to have the chefe seates in the synagoges
040	MAT	023	007	and gretinges in the marketes and to be called of men Rabi.
040	MAT	023	008	But ye shall not suffre youre selves to be called Rabi.  For one is youre master that is to wyt Christ and all ye are brethre.
040	MAT	023	009	And call no man youre father vpon the erth for there is but one youre father and he is in heven.
040	MAT	023	010	Be not called masters for there is but one youre master and he is Christ.
040	MAT	023	011	He that is greatest amoge you shalbe youre seruaunte.
040	MAT	023	012	But whosoever exalteth himsilfe shalbe brought lowe.  And he yt hubleth himsilfe shalbe exalted.
040	MAT	023	013	Wo be vnto you Scribes and Pharises ypocrites for ye shutte vp the kyngdome of heve before men: ye youre selves goo not in nether suffre ye them that come to enter in.
040	MAT	023	014	Wo be vnto you Scribes and Pharises ypocrites: ye devoure widdowes houses and that vnder a coloure of praying longe prayers: wherfore ye shall receave greater damnacion.
040	MAT	023	015	Wo be vnto you Scribes and Pharises ypocrites which compasse see and londe to bringe one in to youre belefe: and when he ys brought ye make him two folde more the chylde of hell then ye youre selves are.
040	MAT	023	016	Wo be vnto you blynd gides which saye whosoever sweare by the teple it is no thinge: but whosoever sweare by the golde of the temple he offendeth.
040	MAT	023	017	Ye foles and blinde?  whether is greater the golde or the teple that sanctifieth ye golde.
040	MAT	023	018	And whosoever sweareth by the aulter it is nothinge: but whosoever sweareth by ye offeringe yt lyeth on ye aultre offendeth.
040	MAT	023	019	Ye foles and blinde: whether is greater ye offeringe or ye aultre which sanctifieth ye offeringe?
040	MAT	023	020	Whosoever therfore sweareth by ye aultre sweareth by it and by all yt there on is.
040	MAT	023	021	And whosoever sweareth by the teple sweareth by it and by hym yt dwelleth therin.
040	MAT	023	022	And he that sweareth by heve swereth by the seate of God and by hym that sytteth theron.
040	MAT	023	023	Wo be to you Scribes and Pharises ypocrites which tythe mynt annyse and comen and leave the waygthtyer mattres of ye lawe vndone: iudgemet mercy and fayth.  These ought ye to have done and not to have left the othre vndone.
040	MAT	023	024	Ye blinde gydes which strayne out a gnat and swalowe a cammyll.
040	MAT	023	025	Wo be to you scribes and pharises ypocrites which make clene ye vtter syde of the cuppe and of the platter: but within they are full of brybery and excesse.
040	MAT	023	026	Thou blinde Pharise clense fyrst the outsyde of the cup and platter that the ynneside of them maye be clene also.
040	MAT	023	027	Wo be to you Scribe and Pharises ypocrite for ye are lyke vnto paynted tombes which appere beautyfull outwarde: but are wt in full of deed bones and of all fylthynes.
040	MAT	023	028	So are ye for outwarde ye appere righteous vnto me when within ye are full of ypocrisie and iniquite.
040	MAT	023	029	Wo be vnto you Scribes and Pharises ypocrites: ye bylde the tombes of the Prophetes and garnisshe the sepulchres of the righteous
040	MAT	023	030	and saye: Yf we had bene in the dayes of oure fathers we wolde not have bene parteners with them in the bloud of the Prophetes.
040	MAT	023	031	So then ye be witnesses vnto youre selfes that ye are the chyldren of them which killed the prophetes.
040	MAT	023	032	Fulfill ye lyke wyse the measure of youre fathers.
040	MAT	023	033	Yee serpentes and generacion of vipers how shuld ye scape ye dapnacio of hell?
040	MAT	023	034	Wherfore beholde I sende vnto you prophetes wyse men and scribes and of the ye shall kyll and crucifie: and of the ye shall scourge in youre synagoges and persecute from cyte to cyte
040	MAT	023	035	that vpon you maye come all the righteous bloude that was sheed vpon the erth fro the bloud of righteous Abell vnto ye bloud of zacharias the sonne of Barachias who ye slewe betwene the teple and ye altre.
040	MAT	023	036	Verely I say vnto you all these thinges shall light vpon this generacion.
040	MAT	023	037	Hierusalem hierusalem which kyllest prophetes and stonest the which are sent to the: how often wolde I have gadered thy chyldren to gether as the henne gadreth her chickes vnder her winges but ye wolde not:
040	MAT	023	038	Beholde youre habitacio shalbe lefte vnto you desolate.
040	MAT	023	039	For I saye to you ye shall not se me heceforthe tyll that ye saye: blessed is he that cometh in the name of ye Lorde.
040	MAT	024	001	And Iesus went out and departed fro the teple: and his disciples came to hym for to shewe him the byldinge of the teple.
040	MAT	024	002	Iesus sayde vnto the: se ye not all these thinges?  Verely I saye vnto you: ther shall not be here lefte one stone vpon another that shall not be cast doune.
040	MAT	024	003	And as he sat vpon the mout Olivete his disciples came vnto hym secretely sayinge.  Tell vs when these thinges shalbe?  And what signe shalbe of thy comynge and of the ende of the worlde?
040	MAT	024	004	And Iesus answered and sayde vnto them: take hede that no ma deceave you.
040	MAT	024	005	For many shall come in my name sayinge: I am Christ and shall deceave many.
040	MAT	024	006	Ye shall heare of warres and of the fame of warres: but se yt ye be not troubled.  For all these thinges must come to passe but the ende is not yet.
040	MAT	024	007	For nacio shall ryse ageynste nacio and realme ageynste realme: and ther shalbe pestilence honger and erthquakes in all quarters.
040	MAT	024	008	All these are the beginninge of sorowes.
040	MAT	024	009	Then shall they put you to trouble and shall kyll you: and ye shalbe hated of all nacions for my names sake.
040	MAT	024	010	And then shall many be offended and shall betraye one another and shall hate one the other.
040	MAT	024	011	And many falce Prophetes shall aryse and shall deceave many.
040	MAT	024	012	And because iniquite shall have the vpper hande the love of many shall abate.
040	MAT	024	013	But he that endureth to the ende the same shalbe safe.
040	MAT	024	014	And this gladtidingees of the kyngdome shalbe preached in all the worlde for a witnes vnto all nacions: and then shall the ende come.
040	MAT	024	015	When ye therfore shall se ye abhominacio that betokeneth desolacion spoken of by Daniell the Prophet stonde in ye holy place: let him that redeth it vnderstonde it.
040	MAT	024	016	Then let them which be in Iury flye into the moutaynes.
040	MAT	024	017	And let him which is on ye housse toppe not come downe to fet eny thinge out of his housse.
040	MAT	024	018	Nether let him which is in ye felde returne backe to fetche his clothes.
040	MAT	024	019	Wo be in those dayes to the that are wt chylde and to the yt geve sucke.
040	MAT	024	020	But praye yt youre flight be not in ye winter nether on ye saboth daye.
040	MAT	024	021	For then shalbe greate tribulacio suche as was not fro the beginninge of the worlde to this tyme ner shalbe.
040	MAT	024	022	Ye and except those dayes shuld be shortened there shuld no fleshe be saved: but for ye chosens sake those dayes shalbe shortened.
040	MAT	024	023	Then yf eny ma shall saye vnto you: lo here is Christ or there is Christ: beleve it not.
040	MAT	024	024	For there shall arise false christes and false prophete and shall do great myracles and wondres.  In so moche yt if it were possible ye verie electe shuld be deceaved.
040	MAT	024	025	Take hede I have tolde you before.
040	MAT	024	026	Wherfore if they shall saye vnto you: beholde he is in ye desert go not forth: beholde he is in ye secret places beleve not.
040	MAT	024	027	For as ye lightninge cometh out of ye eest and shyneth vnto the weest: so shall the comynge of the sonne of ma be.
040	MAT	024	028	For wheresoever a deed karkas is eve thyther will the egles resorte.
040	MAT	024	029	Immediatly after the tribulacios of those dayes shall the sunne be derkened: and ye mone shall not geve hir light and the starre shall fall from heve and the powers of heve shall move.
040	MAT	024	030	And then shall appere the sygne of the sonne of man in heven.  And then shall all the kynreddes of the erth morne and they shall se the sonne of man come in the cloudes of heven with power and greate glorie.
040	MAT	024	031	And he shall sende his angeles with the greate voyce of a trope and they shall gader to gether his chosen from the fower wyndes and from the one ende of the worlde to the other.
040	MAT	024	032	Learne, a similitude of the fygge tree: when his braunches are yet tender and his leves sproge ye knowe that sommer is nye.
040	MAT	024	033	So lyke wyse ye when ye see all these thynges be ye sure that it is neare even at the dores.
040	MAT	024	034	Verely I saye vnto you that this generacion shall not passe tyll all these be fulfilled.
040	MAT	024	035	Heven and erth shall perisshe: but my wordes shall abyde.
040	MAT	024	036	But of that daye and houre knowith no man no not ye angels of heve but my father only.
040	MAT	024	037	As the tyme of Noe was so lyke wyse shall the cominge of ye sonne of man be.
040	MAT	024	038	For as in ye dayes before ye floud: they dyd eate and drynke mary and were maried eve vnto ye daye that Noe entred into the shyppe
040	MAT	024	039	and knewe of nothynge tyll the floude came and toke them all awaye.  So shall also the commynge of the sonne of man be.
040	MAT	024	040	Then two shalbe in the feldes the one shalbe receaved and the other shalbe refused
040	MAT	024	041	two shalbe gryndinge at ye myll: ye oue shalbe receaved and ye other shalbe refused.
040	MAT	024	042	Wake therfore because ye knowe not what houre youre master wyll come.
040	MAT	024	043	Of this be sure that yf the good man of the housse knewe what houre the thefe wolde come: he wolde suerly watche and not suffre his housse to be broke vppe.
040	MAT	024	044	Therfore be ye also redy for in ye houre ye thinke he wolde not: wyll the sonne of ma come.
040	MAT	024	045	If there be any faithfull servaut and wyse whome his master hath made ruler over his housholde to geve the meate in season covenient:
040	MAT	024	046	happy is that servaunt whom his master (when he cometh) shall finde so doinge.
040	MAT	024	047	Verely I saye vnto you he shall make him ruler over all his goodes.
040	MAT	024	048	But and yf that evill servaut shall saye in his herte my master wyll defer his comynge
040	MAT	024	049	and beginne to smyte his felowes ye and to eate and to drinke with the dronke:
040	MAT	024	050	that servauntes master wyll come in adaye when he loketh not for him and in an houre yt he is not ware of
040	MAT	024	051	and wyll devyde him and geve him his rewarde with ypocrites.  There shalbe wepinge and gnasshinge of tethe.
040	MAT	025	001	Then ye kyngdome of heven shalbe lykened vnto. x.  virgins which toke their lampes and wet to mete the brydgrome:
040	MAT	025	002	fyve of them were folysshe and fyve were wyse.
040	MAT	025	003	The folysshe toke their lampes but toke none oyle wt the.
040	MAT	025	004	But ye wyse tooke oyle wt the in their vesselles wt their lampes also.
040	MAT	025	005	Whill the brydgrome taryed all slombred and slepte.
040	MAT	025	006	And even at mydnyght there was a crye made: beholde the brydgrome cometh goo out against him.
040	MAT	025	007	Then all those virgins arose and prepared their lampes.
040	MAT	025	008	And ye folysshe sayde to ye wyse: geve vs of youre oyle for our lampes goo out?
040	MAT	025	009	but ye wyse answered sayinge.  Not so lest ther be not ynough for vs and you: but goo rather to them yt sell and by for youre selves.
040	MAT	025	010	And whill they went to bye ye brydgrome came: and they yt were redy went in with him to ye weddinge and the gate was shett vp:
040	MAT	025	011	Afterwardes came also ye other virgins sayinge: master master open to vs.
040	MAT	025	012	But he answered and sayde: verely I saye vnto you: I knowe not you.
040	MAT	025	013	Watche therefore: for ye knowe nether the daye nor yet the houre when the sonne of man shall come.
040	MAT	025	014	Lykwyse as a certeyne ma redy to take his iorney to a straunge coutre called his servautes and delivered to them his gooddes.
040	MAT	025	015	And vnto one he gave. v.  talentes to another. ii.  and to another one: to every man after his abilite and streyght waye departed.
040	MAT	025	016	Then he that had receaved the fyve talentes went and bestowed them and wanne other fyve talentes.
040	MAT	025	017	Lykwyse he that receaved. ii.  gayned other. ii.
040	MAT	025	018	But he yt receaved ye one went and digged a pit in the erth and hyd his masters money.
040	MAT	025	019	After a longe season ye lorde of those servauntes came and rekened with the.
040	MAT	025	020	Then came he yt had receaved fyve talentes and brought other fyve talentes sayinge: master thou deliveredst vnto one fyve talentes: beholde I have gayned wt the fyve talentes moo.
040	MAT	025	021	The his master sayde vnto him: well good servaut and faithfull.  Thou hast bene faithfull in lytell I will make the ruler over moche: entre in into thy masters ioye.
040	MAT	025	022	Also he that receaved. ii.  talentes came and sayde: master thou deliveredest vnto me. ii.  talentes: beholde I have wone. ii.  other talentes with them.
040	MAT	025	023	And his master sayde vnto him well good servaunt and faithfull.  Thou hast bene faithfull in lytell I wyll make the ruler over moche: go in into thy masters ioye.
040	MAT	025	024	Then he which had receaved ye one talent came and sayd: master I considered yt thou wast an harde man which repest where thou sowedst not and gadderest where thou strawedst not
040	MAT	025	025	and was therfore afrayde and went and hyd thy talent in ye erth: Beholde thou hast thyn awne.
040	MAT	025	026	His master answered and sayde vnto him: thou evyll servaut and slewthfull thou knewest yt I repe where I sowed not and gaddre where I strawed not:
040	MAT	025	027	thou oughtest therfore to have had my money to ye chaugers and then at my comynge shulde I have receaved myne awne with vauntage.
040	MAT	025	028	Take therfore the talent from him and geve it vnto him which hath. x.  talentes.
040	MAT	025	029	For vnto every man that hath shalbe geven and he shall have aboundance: and from him that hath not shalbe taken awaye even that he hath.
040	MAT	025	030	And cast yt vnprofitable servaunt into vtter dercknes: there shalbe wepynge and gnasshinge of teeth.
040	MAT	025	031	When the sonne of ma cometh in his glorie and all the holy angels wt him then shall he syt vpon the seate of his glorie
040	MAT	025	032	and before him shalbe Gaddred all nacions.  And he shall seperate the one from a nother as a shepherde deuideth the shepe from the gootes.
040	MAT	025	033	And he shall set the shepe on his right honde and the gotes on the lyfte.
040	MAT	025	034	Then shall the kynge saye to them on his right honde: Come ye blessed chyldren of my father inheret ye the kyngdo prepared for you from the beginninge of the worlde.
040	MAT	025	035	For I was anhongred and ye gave me meate.  I thursted and ye gave me drinke.  I was herbourlesse and ye lodged me.
040	MAT	025	036	I was naked and ye clothed me.  I was sicke and ye visited me.  I was in preson and ye came vnto me.
040	MAT	025	037	Then shall ye righteous answere him sayinge master whe sawe we ye anhongred and feed the?  or a thurst and gave ye drinke?
040	MAT	025	038	when sawe we ye herbourlesse and lodged the?  or naked and clothed the?
040	MAT	025	039	or when sawe we the sicke or in preson and came vnto the?
040	MAT	025	040	And ye kynge shall answere and saye vnto them: verely I saye vnto you: in as moche as ye have done it vnto one of ye leest of these my brethren ye have done it to me.
040	MAT	025	041	Then shall the kynge saye vnto them that shalbe on the lyfte hande: departe from me ye coursed into everlastinge fire which is prepared for the devyll and his angels.
040	MAT	025	042	For I was an hungred and ye gave me no meate.  I thursted and ye gave me no drinke.
040	MAT	025	043	I was herbourlesse and ye lodged me not.  I was naked and ye clothed me not.  I was sicke and in preson and ye visited me not.
040	MAT	025	044	Then shall they also answere him sayinge: master when sawe we the an hungred or a thurst or herbourlesse or naked or sicke or in preson and did not ministre vnto the?
040	MAT	025	045	Then shall he answere the and saye: Verely I saye vnto you in as moche as ye did it not to one of ye leest of these ye did it not to me.
040	MAT	025	046	And these shall go into everlastinge payne: And the righteous into lyfe eternall.
040	MAT	026	001	And it came to passe when Iesus had fynisshed all these sayinges he sayd vnto his disciples:
040	MAT	026	002	Ye knowe that after ii.  dayes shalbe ester and the sonne of man shalbe delyvered to be crucified.
040	MAT	026	003	Then assembled togedder the chefe prestes and the scribes and the elders of the people to the palice of the hye preste called Cayphas
040	MAT	026	004	and heelde a counsell how they mygt take Iesus by suttelte and kyll him.
040	MAT	026	005	But they sayd not on the holy daye lest eny vproure aryse amonge the people.
040	MAT	026	006	When Iesus was in Bethany in the house of Symon the leper
040	MAT	026	007	ther came vnto him a woman which had an alablaster boxe of precious oyntment and powred it on his heed as he sate at the bourde.
040	MAT	026	008	When his disciples sawe that they had indignacion sayinge: what neded this wast?
040	MAT	026	009	This oyntmet myght have bene well solde and geven to the povre.
040	MAT	026	010	When Iesus vnderstod that he sayde vnto the: why trouble ye the woman?  She hath wrought a good worke apon me.
040	MAT	026	011	For ye shall have povre folcke alwayes with you: but me shall ye not have all wayes.
040	MAT	026	012	And in yt she casted this oyntment on my bodye she dyd it to burye me wt all.
040	MAT	026	013	Verely I saye vnto you wheresoever this gospell shalbe preached throughoute all the worlde there shall also this that she hath done be tolde for a memoriall of her.
040	MAT	026	014	Then one of the twelve called Iudas Iscarioth went vnto the chefe prestes
040	MAT	026	015	and sayd: what will ye geve me and I will deliver him vnto you?  And they apoynted vnto him thirty peces of sylver.
040	MAT	026	016	And from that tyme he sought oportunite to betraye him.
040	MAT	026	017	The fyrst daye of swete breed ye disciples cam to Iesus sayinge vnto him: where wylt thou that we prepare for ye to eate ye paschall lambe?
040	MAT	026	018	And he sayd: Go into the cite vnto soche a man and saye to him: the master sayeth my tyme is at hande I will kepe myne ester at thy housse with my disciples.
040	MAT	026	019	And the disciples did as Iesus had apoynted them and made redy the esterlambe.
040	MAT	026	020	When the even was come he sate doune wt the. xii.
040	MAT	026	021	And as they dyd eate he sayde: Verely I saye vnto you that one of you shall betraye me.
040	MAT	026	022	And they were excedinge sorowfull and beganne every one of the to saye vnto him: is it I master?
040	MAT	026	023	He answered and sayde: he yt deppeth his honde wt me in ye disshe the same shall betraye me.
040	MAT	026	024	The sonne of ma goeth as it is written of him: but wo be to yt ma by whom ye sonne of man shalbe betrayed.  It had bene good for that man yf he had never bene borne.
040	MAT	026	025	Then Iudas wich betrayed him answered and sayde: is it I master?  He sayde vnto him: thou hast sayde.
040	MAT	026	026	As they dyd eate Iesus toke breed and gave thankes brake it and gave it to the disciples and sayde: Take eate this is my body.
040	MAT	026	027	And he toke the cup and thanked and gave it them sayinge: drinke of it every one.
040	MAT	026	028	For this is my bloude of the new testament that shalbe shedde for many for the remission of synnes.
040	MAT	026	029	I saye vnto you: I will not drinke hence forth of this frute of the vyne tree vntyll that daye when I shall drinke it new with you in my fathers kyngdome.
040	MAT	026	030	And when they had sayde grace they went out into mounte olyvete.
040	MAT	026	031	Then sayd Iesus vnto them: all ye shall be offended by me this night.  For it is wrytten.  I will smyte ye shepe herde and the shepe of ye flocke shalbe scattered abroode.
040	MAT	026	032	But after I am rysen ageyne I will goo before you into Galile.
040	MAT	026	033	Peter answered and sayde vnto him: though all men shulde be offended by ye yet wolde I never be offended.
040	MAT	026	034	Iesus sayde vnto him.  Verely I saye vnto ye that this same night before the cocke crowe thou shalt denye me thryse.
040	MAT	026	035	Peter sayde vnto him: Yf I shulde dye with ye yet wolde I not denye ye Lyke wyse also sayde all ye disciples.
040	MAT	026	036	Then went Iesus with them into a place which is called Gethsemane and sayde vnto the disciples syt ye here whyll I go and praye yonder.
040	MAT	026	037	And he toke with him Peter and the two sonnes of zebede and began to wexe sorowfull and to be in an agonye.
040	MAT	026	038	Then sayd Iesus vnto them: my soule is hevy even vnto the deeth.  Tary ye here and watche wt me.
040	MAT	026	039	And he went a lytell aparte and fell flat on his face and prayed sayinge: O my father yf it be possible let this cuppe passe from me: neverthelesse not as I wyll but as thou wylt.
040	MAT	026	040	And he came vnto the disciples and founde them a slepe and sayde to Peter: what coulde ye not watche with me one houre:
040	MAT	026	041	watche and praye that ye fall not into temptacion.  The spirite is willynge but the flesshe is weake.
040	MAT	026	042	He went awaye once moare and prayed sayinge: O my father yf this cuppe can not passe away from me but yt I drinke of it thy wyll be fulfylled.
040	MAT	026	043	And he came and founde the a slepe agayne.  For their eyes were hevy.
040	MAT	026	044	And he lefte them and went agayne and prayed ye thrid tyme sayinge ye same wordes.
040	MAT	026	045	Then came he to his disciples and sayd vnto them: Slepe hence forth and take youre reest.  Take hede the houre is at honde and ye sonne of man shalbe betrayed into ye hondes of synners.
040	MAT	026	046	Ryse let vs be goinge: beholde he is at honde yt shall betraye me.
040	MAT	026	047	Whyll he yet spake: lo Iudas one of ye xii.  came and wt him a greate multitude wt sweardes and staves sent from the chefe prestes and elders of the people.
040	MAT	026	048	And he that betrayed him had geven the a token sayinge: whosoever I kysse yt same is he ley hondes on him.
040	MAT	026	049	And forth wt all he came to Iesus and sayde: hayle master and kyssed him.
040	MAT	026	050	And Iesus sayde vnto him: frende wherfore arte thou come?  Then came they and layed hondes on Iesus and toke him.
040	MAT	026	051	And beholde one of them which were with Iesus stretched oute his honde and drue his swearde and stroke a servaunt of the hye preste and smote of his eare.
040	MAT	026	052	Then sayde Iesus vnto him: put vp thy swearde into his sheathe.  For all that ley hond on ye swearde shall perisshe with ye swearde.
040	MAT	026	053	Ether thinkest thou that I cannot now praye to my father and he shall geve me moo then. xii.  legions of angelles?
040	MAT	026	054	But how then shuld the scriptures be fulfylled: for so must it be.
040	MAT	026	055	The same tyme sayd Iesus to the multitude: ye be come out as it were vnto a thefe with sweardes and staves for to take me.  I sate daylie teachinge in the temple amoge you and ye toke me not.
040	MAT	026	056	All this was done that the scriptures of the Prophetes myght be fulfilled.
040	MAT	026	057	Then all the disciples forsoke him and fleed.  And they toke Iesus and leed him to Cayphas the hye preeste where the Scribes and the Elders where assembled.
040	MAT	026	058	And Peter folowed him a farre of vnto the hye prestes place: and went in and sate with the servauntes to se the ende.
040	MAT	026	059	The chefe prestes and the elders and all the counsell sought false witnes agenste Iesus for to put him to deeth
040	MAT	026	060	but founde none: in somoche that when many false witnesses cam yet founde they none.  At the last came two false witnesses
040	MAT	026	061	and sayd: This felowe sayde: I can distroye the temple of God and bylde it agayne in. iii.  dayes.
040	MAT	026	062	And the chefe preste arose and sayde to him: answerest thou nothinge?  How is it yt these beare witnes ageynst the?
040	MAT	026	063	But Iesus helde his peace: And the chefe Preeste answered and sayd to him: I charge the in the name of the lyvinge God that thou tell vs whether thou be Christ the sonne of God.
040	MAT	026	064	Iesus sayd to him: thou haste sayd.  Neverthelesse I saye vnto you hereafter shall ye se the sonne of ma syttinge on the right honde of power and come in the clowddes of the skye.
040	MAT	026	065	Then the hye preste rent his clothes sayinge: He hath blasphemed: what nede we of eny moo witnesses?  Behold now ye have hearde his blasphemy:
040	MAT	026	066	what thinke ye?  They answered and sayd: he his worthy to dye.
040	MAT	026	067	Then spat they in his face and boffeted him with fistes.  And other smote him with the palme af their hondes
040	MAT	026	068	on ye face sayinge: tell vs thou Christ who is he that smote the?
040	MAT	026	069	Peter sate with out in the palice.  And a damsell came to him sayinge: Thou also waste wt Iesus of Galilee:
040	MAT	026	070	but he denyed before the all sayinge: I woot not what thou sayst.
040	MAT	026	071	When he was goone out into the poorche another wenche sawe him and sayde vnto them that were there: This felowe was also with Iesus of Nazareth.
040	MAT	026	072	And agayne he denyed with an oothe that he knew the man.
040	MAT	026	073	And after a whyle came vnto him they yt stode bye and sayde vnto Peter: suerly thou arte even one of the for thy speache bewreyeth ye.
040	MAT	026	074	Then beganne he to course and to sweare that he knewe not the man.  And immedyatly the cocke krewe.
040	MAT	026	075	And Peter remembred the wordes of Iesu which sayde vnto him: before the cocke crowe thou shalt deny me thryse: and went out at the dores and wepte bitterly.
040	MAT	027	001	When the mornynge was come all ye chefe prestes and the elders of ye people helde a counsayle agenst Iesu to put him to deeth
040	MAT	027	002	and brought him bounde and delivered him vnto Poncius Pilate the debite.
040	MAT	027	003	Then when Iudas which betrayed him sawe that he was condempned he repented him sylfe and brought ageyne the. xxx.  plattes of sylver to ye chefe prestes and elders
040	MAT	027	004	sayinge: I have synned betrayinge the innocent bloud.  And they sayde: what is that to vs?  Se thou to that.
040	MAT	027	005	And he cast doune the sylver plattes in the temple and departed and went and hounge him sylfe.
040	MAT	027	006	And the chefe prestes toke the sylver plattes and sayd: it is not lawfull for to put them in to the treasury because it is the pryce of bloud.
040	MAT	027	007	And they toke counsell and bought with them a potters felde to bury strangers in.
040	MAT	027	008	Wherfore that felde is called the felde of bloud vntyll this daye.
040	MAT	027	009	Then was fulfylled that which was spoken by Ieremy the Prophet sayinge: and they toke. xxx.  sylver plattes the prise of him that was valued whom they bought of the chyldren of Israel
040	MAT	027	010	and they gave them for the potters felde as the Lorde appoynted me.
040	MAT	027	011	Iesus stode before the debite: and the debite axed him sayinge: Arte thou the kynge of ye Iues?  Iesus sayd vnto him: Thou sayest
040	MAT	027	012	and when he was accused of ye chefe prestes and elders he answered nothinge.
040	MAT	027	013	Then sayd Pilate vnto him: hearest thou not how many thinges they laye ageynste ye?
040	MAT	027	014	And he answered him to never a worde: in so moche that the debite marveylled greatlie.
040	MAT	027	015	At that feest the debite was wonte to deliver vnto ye people a presoner whom they wolde desyer.
040	MAT	027	016	He had then a notable presoner called Barrabas.
040	MAT	027	017	And when they were gadered together Pilate sayde vnto the: whether wyll ye that I geve losse vnto you Barrabas or Iesus which is called Christ?
040	MAT	027	018	For he knewe well that for envie they had delivred him.
040	MAT	027	019	When he was set doune to geve iudgemet his wyfe sent to him sayinge: have thou nothinge to do with that iuste man.  For I have suffered many thinges this daye in a dreame about him.
040	MAT	027	020	But the chefe preestes and the elders had parswaded the people that they shulde axe Barrabas and shulde destroye Iesus.
040	MAT	027	021	Then the debite answered and sayde vnto them: whether of the twayne wyll ye that I let loosse vnto you?  And they sayde Barrabas.
040	MAT	027	022	Pilate sayde vnto them: what shall I do then with Iesus which is called Christ?  They all sayde to him: let him be crucified.
040	MAT	027	023	Then sayde the debite: what evyll hath he done?  And they cryed the more sayinge: let him be crucified.
040	MAT	027	024	When Pilate sawe that he prevayled nothinge but that moare busines was made he toke water and wasshed his hondes before ye people sayinge: I am innocent of the bloud of this iuste person and that ye shall se.
040	MAT	027	025	Then answered all the people and sayde: his bloud be on vs and on oure chyldren.
040	MAT	027	026	Then let he Barrabas loose vnto them and scourged Iesus and delivered him to be crucified.
040	MAT	027	027	Then the soudeours of the debite toke Iesus vnto the comen hall and gaddered vnto him all the company.
040	MAT	027	028	And they stripped him and put on him a purpyll roobe
040	MAT	027	029	and platted a croune of thornes and put vpon his heed and a rede in his ryght honde: and bowed their knees before him and mocked him saying: hayle kinge of the Iewes:
040	MAT	027	030	and spitted vpon him and toke the rede and smoote him on the heed.
040	MAT	027	031	And when they had mocked him they toke the robe of him ageyne and put his awne reymet on him and leed him awaye to crucify him.
040	MAT	027	032	And as they came out they fonnde a man of Cyren named Simon: him they compelled to beare his crosse.
040	MAT	027	033	And whe they cam vnto ye place called Golgotha (that is to saye a place of deed mens sculles)
040	MAT	027	034	they gave him veneger to drinke mengled with gall.  And when he had tasted therof he wolde not drinke.
040	MAT	027	035	When they had crucified him they parted his garmentes and did cast lottes: to fulfyll that was spoken by the prophet.  They deuyded my garmetes amonge them: and apon my vesture did cast loottes.
040	MAT	027	036	And they sate and watched him there.
040	MAT	027	037	And they set vp over his heed the cause of his deeth written.  This is Iesus the kynge of the Iewes.
040	MAT	027	038	And ther were two theves crucified with him one on ye right honde and another on the lyfte.
040	MAT	027	039	They that passed by revyled him waggynge ther heeddes
040	MAT	027	040	and sayinge: Thou that destroyest the temple of God and byldest it in thre dayes save thy sylfe.  If thou be ye sonne of God come doune from the crosse.
040	MAT	027	041	Lykwyse also the hye prestes mockinge him with the scribes aud elders sayde:
040	MAT	027	042	He saved other him sylfe he can not save.  If he be ye kynge of Israel: let him now come doune from the crosse and we will beleve him.
040	MAT	027	043	He trusted in God let him deliver him now yf he will have him: for he sayde I am the sonne of God.
040	MAT	027	044	That same also the theves which were crucified with him cast in his tethe.
040	MAT	027	045	From the sixte houre was there dercknes over all the londe vnto the nynth houre.
040	MAT	027	046	And about ye nynth houre Iesus cryed with a loude voyce sayinge: Eli Eli lama asbathani.  That is to saye my God my God why hast thou forsaken me?
040	MAT	027	047	Some of them that stode there when they herde that sayde: This man calleth for Helyas.
040	MAT	027	048	And streyght waye one of them ranne and toke a sponge and filled it full of veneger and put it on a rede and gave him to drinke.
040	MAT	027	049	Other sayde let be: let vs se whyther Helyas will come and deliver him.
040	MAT	027	050	Iesus cryed agayne with a lowde voyce and yelded vp the goost.
040	MAT	027	051	And beholde the vayle of the temple dyd rent in twayne from ye toppe to the bottome and the erth dyd quake and the stones dyd rent
040	MAT	027	052	and graves dyd open: and the bodies of many sainctes which slept arose
040	MAT	027	053	and came out of ye graves after his resurreccion and came into the holy cite and appered vnto many.
040	MAT	027	054	When the Centurion and they that were with him watchinge Iesus sawe ye erth quake and those thinges which hapened they feared greatly sayinge.  Of a surete this was the sonne of God.

041	MAR	012	015	Ought we to geve or ought we not to geve?  He vnderstode their simulacion and sayde vnto them: Why tepte ye me?  Brynge me a peny that I maye se yt.
041	MAR	012	016	And they brought.  And he sayde vnto them: Whose ys thys ymage and superscripcion?  And they sayde vnto him Cesars.

041	MAR	012	023	In the resurreccio then when they shall ryse agayne: whose wyfe shall she be of them?  For seven had her to wyfe.
041	MAR	012	024	Iesus answered and sayde vnto them: Are ye not therfore deceaved and vnderstonde not the scryptures nether the power of God?
041	MAR	012	025	For when they shall ryse agayne fro deeth they nether mary nor are maryed: but are as the angels which are in heven.
041	MAR	012	026	As touchynge the deed that they shall ryse agayne: have ye not redde in the boke of Moses howe in the busshe God spake vnto him sayinge: I am the God of Abraham and God of Ysaac and the God of Iacob?
041	MAR	012	027	He is not the God of the deed but the God of the livynge.  Ye are therfore greatly deceaved.

041	MAR	012	031	And the seconde is lyke vnto this: Thou shalt love thy neghbour as thy silfe.  Ther is none other commaundement greater then these.
041	MAR	012	032	And the Scribe sayde vnto him: well master thou hast sayd ye truthe that ther ys one God and that ther is none but he.
041	MAR	012	033	And to love him with all the herte and with all the mynde and with all the soule and with all the stregth: and to love a mans neghbour as him silfe ys a greater thinge then all burntofferings and sacrifices.
041	MAR	012	034	And when Iesus sawe that he answered discretly he sayde vnto him: Thou arte not farre from the kyngdome of God.  And no man after that durst axe him eny questio.

042	LUK	001	001	For as moche as many have take in hand to compyle a treates of thoo thinges which are surely knowen amonge vs
042	LUK	001	002	even as they declared them vnto vs which from the beginnynge sawe them their selves and were ministers at the doyng:
042	LUK	001	003	I determined also assone as I had searched out diligently all thinges from the beginnynge that then I wolde wryte vnto the good Theophilus:
042	LUK	001	004	that thou myghtest knowe the certente of thoo thinges wher of thou arte informed.
042	LUK	001	005	There was in the dayes of Herode kynge of Iurie a certayne prest named Zacharias of ye course of Abia.  And his wyfe was of ye doughters of Aaron: And her name was Elizabeth.
042	LUK	001	006	Booth were perfect before God and walked in all the lawes and ordinaces of the Lorde that no man coulde fynde fawte with them.
042	LUK	001	007	And they had no chylde because that Elizabeth was barre and booth were well stricken in age.
042	LUK	001	008	And it cam to passe as he executed the prestes office before god as his course came
042	LUK	001	009	(accordinge to the custome of the prestes office) his lot was to bourne incece.
042	LUK	001	010	And wet into ye teple of ye Lorde and the whoale multitude of ye people were with out in prayer whill the incense was aburnynge.
042	LUK	001	011	And ther appered vnto him an angell of the lorde stondinge on the ryght syde of the altare of incense.
042	LUK	001	012	And when Zacharias sawe him he was abasshed and feare came on him.
042	LUK	001	013	And the angell sayde vnto him: feare not Zachary for thy prayer is hearde: And thy wyfe Elizabeth shall beare ye a sonne and thou shalt call his name Iohn
042	LUK	001	014	and thou shalt have ioye and gladnes and many shall reioyce at his birth.
042	LUK	001	015	For he shalbe greate in the sight of the lorde and shall nether drinke wyne ner stronge drinke.  And he shalbe filled with the holy goost even in his mothers wombe:
042	LUK	001	016	and many of the chyldren of Israel shall he tourne to their Lorde God.
042	LUK	001	017	And he shall goo before him in the sprete and power of Helyas to tourne the hertes of the fathers to the chyldren and the vnbelevers to the wysdom of the iuste men: to make the people redy for the Lorde.
042	LUK	001	018	And Zacharias sayde vnto ye angell: Wher by shall I knowe this?  seinge that I am olde and my wyfe well stricken in yeares.
042	LUK	001	019	And the angell answered and sayde vnto him: I am Gabriell that stonde in the presens of God and am sent to speake vnto the: and to shewe the these glad tydinges.
042	LUK	001	020	And beholde thou shalt be domme and not able to speake vntyll the tyme that these thinges be performed because thou belevedst not my wordes which shalbe fulfilled in their season.
042	LUK	001	021	And the people wayted for Zacharias and mervelled that he taryed in the temple.
042	LUK	001	022	And whe he cam oute he could not speake vnto them.  Wherby they perceaved that he had sene some vision in the temple.  And he beckened vnto them and remayned speachlesse.
042	LUK	001	023	And it fortuned assone as ye tyme of his office was oute he departed home into his awne housse.
042	LUK	001	024	And after thoose dayes his wyfe Elizabeth coceaved and hyd her sylfe. v.  monethes sayinge:
042	LUK	001	025	This wyse hath God dealte wt me in ye dayes when he loked on me to take from me the rebuke yt I suffred amonge men.
042	LUK	001	026	And in ye. vi.  moneth ye angell Gabriel was sent fro god vnto a cite of Galile named Nazareth
042	LUK	001	027	to a virgin spoused to a man whose name was Ioseph of ye housse of David and ye virgins name was Mary.
042	LUK	001	028	And ye angell went in vnto her and sayde: Hayle full of grace ye Lorde is with ye: blessed arte thou amonge wemen.
042	LUK	001	029	When she sawe him she was abasshed at his sayinge: and cast in her mynde what maner of salutacion yt shuld be.
042	LUK	001	030	And ye angell sayde vnto her: feare not Mary: for thou hast founde grace wt god.
042	LUK	001	031	Loo: thou shalt coceave in thy wombe and shalt beare a sonne and shalt call his name Iesus.
042	LUK	001	032	He shalbe greate and shalbe called the sonne of the hyest.  And ye lorde God shall geve vnto him the seate of his father David
042	LUK	001	033	and he shall raygne over ye housse of Iacob forever and of his kyngdome shalbe none ende.
042	LUK	001	034	Then sayd Mary vnto ye angell: How shall this be seinge I knowe not a man?
042	LUK	001	035	And ye angell answered and sayd vnto her: The holy goost shall come apon the and ye power of ye hyest shall over shaddowe ye.  Therfore also yt holy thinge which shalbe borne shalbe called ye sonne of god.
042	LUK	001	036	And beholde thy cosen Elizabeth she hath also conceaved a sonne in her age.  And this is hyr sixte moneth though she be called barren:
042	LUK	001	037	for wt god can nothinge be vnpossible.
042	LUK	001	038	And Mary sayd: beholde ye honde mayden of ye lorde be it vnto me even as thou hast sayde.  And the angell departed from her.
042	LUK	001	039	And Mary arose in thoose dayes and went into ye mountayns wt hast into a cite of Iurie
042	LUK	001	040	and entred into the housse of zachary and saluted Elizabeth.
042	LUK	001	041	And it fortuned as Elizabeth hearde ye salutacion of Mary the babe spronge in her belly.  And Elizabeth was filled with the holy goost
042	LUK	001	042	and cryed with a loude voyce and sayde: Blessed arte thou amonge wemen and blessed is the frute of thy wombe.
042	LUK	001	043	And whence hapeneth this to me that the mother of my Lorde shuld come to me?
042	LUK	001	044	For loo assone as the voyce of thy salutacion sownded in myne eares the babe sprange in my belly for ioye.
042	LUK	001	045	And blessed arte thou that belevedst: for thoose thinges shalbe performed wich were tolde ye from the lorde.
042	LUK	001	046	And Mary sayde.  My soule magnifieth the Lorde.
042	LUK	001	047	And my sprete reioyseth in god my savioure
042	LUK	001	048	For he hath loked on the povre degre of his honde mayde.  Beholde now from hence forth shall all generacions call me blessed.
042	LUK	001	049	For he that is myghty hath done to me greate thinges and holye is his name.
042	LUK	001	050	And his mercy is on them that feare him thorow oute all generacions.
042	LUK	001	051	He sheweth strength with his arme he scattereth them that are proude in the ymaginacion of their hertes.
042	LUK	001	052	He putteth doune the myghty from their seates and exalteth them of lowe degre.

042	LUK	001	068	Blessed be the Lorde God of Israel for he hath visited and redemed his people.
042	LUK	001	069	And hath reysed vp an horne of salvacion vnto vs in the housse of his servaunt David.

042	LUK	002	003	And every man went vnto his awne citie to be taxed.

042	LUK	003	005	Every valley shalbe fylled and every moutayne and hyll shalbe brought lowe.  And crocked thinges shalbe made streight: and the rough wayes shalbe made smoth:
042	LUK	003	006	and all flesshe shall se the saveour sent of God.
042	LUK	003	007	Then sayde he to the people that were come to be baptysed of him: O generacion of vipers who hath taught you to flye from the wrath to come?
042	LUK	003	008	Bringe forth due frutes of repentaunce and begynne not to saye in youre selves we have Abraham to oure father.  For I saye vnto you: God is able of these stones to reyse vp chyldren vnto Abraham.
042	LUK	003	009	Now also ys the axe leyd vnto the rote of the trees: so yt every tree which bringeth not forth good frute shalbe hewe doune and caste in to ye fyre.
042	LUK	003	010	And the people axed him sayinge: What shall we do then?
042	LUK	003	011	He answered and sayde vnto them: He that hath two coottes let him parte with him that hath none: and he that hath meate let him do lyke wyse.
042	LUK	003	012	Then came ther Publicans to be baptised and sayde vnto him: Master what shall we do?
042	LUK	003	013	And he sayde vnto the: requyre no more then that which ys appoynted vnto you.
042	LUK	003	014	The soudyoures lyke wyse demaunded of hym sayinge: and what shall we do?  And he sayde to them: Do violence to noo ma: nether trouble eny man wrongfully: but be content with youre wages.
042	LUK	003	015	As the people were in a doute and all men disputed in their hertes of Iohn whether he were very Christ:
042	LUK	003	016	Ihon answered and sayde to them all: I baptyse you wt water but a stronger then I cometh after me whose shue latchet I am not worthy to vnlouse: he will baptise you with the holy goost and with fyre:
042	LUK	003	017	which hath his fanne in his hond and will pourge his floore and will gader the corne into his barne: but the chaffe wyll he bourne with fyre that never shalbe quenched.
042	LUK	003	018	And many other thinges in his exhortacion preached he vnto the people.
042	LUK	003	019	Then Herode the Tetrach (when he was rebuked of him for Herodias his brother Philippes wyfe and for all the evyls which Herod had done)
042	LUK	003	020	added this above all and leyd Iohn in preson.
042	LUK	003	021	And yt fortuned as all the people receaved baptyme (and when Iesus was baptised and dyd praye) that heave was opened
042	LUK	003	022	and the holy goost came doune in a bodely shape lyke a dove vpo him and a voyce came fro heve sayinge: Thou arte my dere sonne in the do I delyte.

042	LUK	004	001	Iesus then full of the holy goost returnyd fro Iordan and was caryed of ye sprete into wildernes
042	LUK	004	002	and was. xl.  dayes tempted of the devyll.  And in thoose dayes ate he no thinge.  And when they were ended he afterward hongred.
042	LUK	004	003	And the devyll sayde vnto him: yf thou be the sonne of God comaunde this stone yt it be breed.
042	LUK	004	004	And Iesus answered hym sayinge: It is writte: man shall not live by breed only but by every worde of God.
042	LUK	004	005	And ye devyll toke him vp into an hye moutayne and shewed him all the kyngdoms of the worlde eve in ye twincklinge of an eye.
042	LUK	004	006	And ye devyll sayde vnto him: all this power will I geve ye every whit and the glory of the: for yt is delyvered to me and to whosoever I will I geve it.
042	LUK	004	007	Yf thou therfore wilt worshippe me they shalbe all thyne.
042	LUK	004	008	Iesus answered him and sayde: hence from me Sathan.  For it is written: Thou shalt honour the Lorde thy God and him only serve.
042	LUK	004	009	And he caryed him to Ierusalem and set him on a pynacle of the temple and sayd vnto him: Yf thou be the sonne of God cast thy silfe doune from hens.
042	LUK	004	010	For it is written he shall geve his angels charge over the to kepe the
042	LUK	004	011	and with there hondis they shall stey the vp that thou dasshe not thy fote agaynst a stone.
042	LUK	004	012	Iesus answered and sayde to him it is sayd: thou shalt not tempte the Lorde thy God.
042	LUK	004	013	Assone as the devyll had ended all his temptacions he departed from him for a season.
042	LUK	004	014	And Iesus retourned by the power of ye sprete in to Galile and there went a fame of him thorowe oute all the regio roude aboute.
042	LUK	004	015	And he taught in their synagoges and was commended of all men.
042	LUK	004	016	And he came to Nazareth where he was noursed and as hys custome was went in to the synagoge on the Saboth dayes and stode vp for to rede.
042	LUK	004	017	And ther was delyvered vnto him ye boke of ye Prophete Esaias.  And when he had opened the boke he founde the place where it was written.
042	LUK	004	018	The sprete of the lorde vpon me because he hath annoynted me: to preache ye gospell to ye poore he hath sent me: and to heale the broken harted: to preache delyverauce to the captive and sight to the blinde and frely to set at lyberte them that are brused
042	LUK	004	019	and to preache the acceptable yeare of the Lorde.
042	LUK	004	020	And he cloosed the booke and gave it agayne to the minister and sate doune.  And the eyes of all that were in the synagoge were fastened on him.
042	LUK	004	021	And he began to saye vnto them.  This daye is this scripture fulfilled in youre eares.
042	LUK	004	022	And all bare him witnes and wondred at the gracious wordes which proceded oute of his mouth and sayde: Is not this Iosephs sonne?
042	LUK	004	023	And he sayde vnto them: Ye maye very well saye vnto me this proverbe: Phisicion heale thy silfe.  Whatsoever we have heard done in Capernaum do the same here lyke wyse in thyne awne countre.
042	LUK	004	024	And he sayde verely I saye vnto you: No Prophet is accepted in his awne countre.
042	LUK	004	025	But I tell you of a truth many wyddowes were in Israell in the dayes of Helias when hevyn was shet thre yeres and syxe monethes when greate fammisshemet was throughoute all the londe
042	LUK	004	026	and vnto none of them was Helias sent save in to Sarephta besydes Sidon vnto a woma that was a widow.
042	LUK	004	027	And many lepers were in Israel in the tyme of Heliseus the Prophete: and yet none of them was healed savinge Naaman of Siria.
042	LUK	004	028	And as many as were in ye sinagoge when they herde that were filled with wrath:
042	LUK	004	029	and roose vp and thrust him oute of the cite and ledde him eve vnto the edge of the hill wher on their cite was bilte to cast him doune hedlynge.
042	LUK	004	030	But he went his waye eve thorow the myddes of them:
042	LUK	004	031	and came in to Capernaum a cyte of Galile and there taught the on the Saboth dayes.
042	LUK	004	032	And they were astonyed at his doctrine: for his preachige was wt power.
042	LUK	004	033	And in the synagoge ther was a ma which had a sprete of an vncleane devell and cryed with aloude voyce
042	LUK	004	034	sayinge: let me alone what hast thou to do with vs thou Iesus of Nazareth?  Arte thou come to destroye vs?  I knowe the what thou arte eve the holy of God.
042	LUK	004	035	And Iesus rebuked him sayinge: holde thy peace and come oute of him.  And the devyll threwe him in the myddes of them and came oute of him and hurt him not.
042	LUK	004	036	And feare came on them all and they spake amonge them selves sayinge: what maner a thinge is this?  For with auctorite and power he commaundeth the foule spretes and they come out?
042	LUK	004	037	And ye fame of him spreed abroode thorowoute all places of the countre round aboute.
042	LUK	004	038	And he roose vp and came oute of ye sinagoge and entred in to Simons housse.  And Simos motherelawe was take with a greate fever and they made intercession to him for her.
042	LUK	004	039	And he stode over her and rebuked the fever: and it leeft her.  And immediatly she arose and ministred vnto them.
042	LUK	004	040	When the sonne was doune all they that had sicke take with divers deseases brought them vnto him: and he layde his hondes on every one of them and healed them.
042	LUK	004	041	And devils also cam out of many of them crying and saying: thou arte Christ the sonne of God.  And he rebuked them and suffered them not to speake: for they knewe that he was Christ.
042	LUK	004	042	Assone as it was daye he departed and went awaye into a desert place and ye people sought him and came to him and kept him that he shuld not departe from the.
042	LUK	004	043	And he sayde vnto the: I muste to other cities also preache the kyngdome of God: for therfore am I sent.
042	LUK	004	044	And he preached in the synagoges of Galile.
042	LUK	005	001	It came to passe as the people preased vpon him to heare the worde of God that he stoode by the lake of Genezareth:
042	LUK	005	002	and sawe two shippes stonde by the lake syde but the fisshermen were gone out of the and were wasshynge their nettes.
042	LUK	005	003	And he entred in to one of the shippes which perteyned to Simon and prayed him that he wolde thrust out a litell from the londe.  And he sate doune and taught the people out of the ship.
042	LUK	005	004	When he had leeft speakynge he sayde vnto Simon: Launche out in to the depe and let slippe youre nettes to make a draught
042	LUK	005	005	And Simon answered and sayde to him: Master we have labored all nyght and have taken nothinge.  Neverthelater at thy worde I will loose forthe the net.
042	LUK	005	006	And when they had so done they inclosed a greate multitude of fisshes.  And their net brake:
042	LUK	005	007	but they made signes to their felowes which were in the other ship that they shuld come and helpe the And they came: and filled bothe the shippes that they soncke agayne.
042	LUK	005	008	When Simon Peter sawe that he fell doune at Iesus knees sayinge: Lorde goo
042	LUK	005	009	fro me for I am a synfull man.  For he was vtterly astonyed and all that were wt him at ye draught of fisshe which they toke:
042	LUK	005	010	and so was also Iames and Iohn ye sonnes of zebede which were parteners wt Simon.  And Iesus sayde vnto Simon: feare not fro hence forthe thou shalt catche men.
042	LUK	005	011	And they brought the shippes to londe and forsoke all and folowed him.
042	LUK	005	012	And it fortuned as he was in a certayne cite: beholde ther was a man full of leprosy: and when he had spied Iesus he fell on his face and besought him sayinge: Lorde yf thou wilt thou canst make me cleane.
042	LUK	005	013	And he strethed forth ye hond and touched him sayinge: I will be thou cleane.  And immediatly the leprosy departed from him.
042	LUK	005	014	And he warned him that he shuld tell no man: but that he shuld goo and shewe him selfe to the Preste and offer for his clensynge accordinge as Moses commaundement was for a witnes vnto them.
042	LUK	005	015	But so moche the moare went ther a fame abroade of him and moche people cam to geder to heare and to be healed of him of their infirmities.
042	LUK	005	016	And he kepte him silfe aparte in ye wildernesses and gave him silfe to prayer.
042	LUK	005	017	And it happened on a certayne daye that he taught: and ther sate the pharises: and docturs of lawe which were come out of all ye tounes of Galile Iurie and Hierusalem.  And the power of the Lorde was to heale the.
042	LUK	005	018	And beholde me brought a man lyinge in his beed which was taken with a palsie: and sought meanes to brynge him in and to laye him before him.
042	LUK	005	019	And whe they coulde not finde by what waye they might bringe him in be cause of ye prease they wet vp on the toppe of ye housse and let him doune thorowe the tylinge beed and all in the middes before Iesus.
042	LUK	005	020	When he sawe their fayth he sayde vnto him: man thy synnes are forgeven the.
042	LUK	005	021	And the Scribes and the Parises begane to thinke sayinge: What felow is this which speaketh blasphemy?  Who can forgeve synnes but God only?
042	LUK	005	022	When Iesus perceaved their thoughtes he answered and sayde vnto them: What thinke ye in youre hertes?
042	LUK	005	023	Whether is easyar to saye thy synnes are forgeve the or to saye: rise and walke?
042	LUK	005	024	But that ye maye knowe that the sonne of ma hath power to forgeve synnes on erth he sayde vnto ye sicke of the palsie: I saye to the aryse take vp thy beed and go home to thy housse.
042	LUK	005	025	And immediatly he rose vp before them and toke vp his beed where on he laye and departed to his awne housse praysinge God.
042	LUK	005	026	And they were all amased and they lauded God and were filled with feare sayinge: We have sene straunge thynges to daye.
042	LUK	005	027	And after that he went forthe and sawe a Publican named Levi sittinge at the receyte of custome and sayde vnto him: folow me.
042	LUK	005	028	And he leeft all roose vp and folowed him.
042	LUK	005	029	And that same Levi made him a greate feaste at home in his awne housse.  And ther was a greate copany of publicans and of other that sate at meate with him.
042	LUK	005	030	And the Scribes and Pharises murmured agaynst his disciples sayinge: Why eate ye and drinke ye with publicas and synners?
042	LUK	005	031	Iesus answered and sayde vnto the: They yt are whole nede not of ye phisicion: but they yt are sicke.
042	LUK	005	032	I came not to call ye rightewes but synners to repentauce.
042	LUK	005	033	Then they sayde vnto him: Why do the disciples of Iohn fast often and praye and the disciples of ye Pharises also: and thine eate and drinke?
042	LUK	005	034	And he sayde vnto them: Can ye make ye chyldren of the weddinge fast as longe as ye brydgrome is present with the?
042	LUK	005	035	The dayes will come whe the brydgrome shalbe take awaye from them: then shall they fast in those dayes
042	LUK	005	036	Then he spake vnto them in a similitude: No ma putteth a pece of a newe garment in to an olde vesture: for yf he do: then breaketh he the newe and the pece that was taken out of the newe agreeth not wt the olde.
042	LUK	005	037	Also no ma poureth newe wyne into olde vessels.  For yf he do the newe wyne breaketh the vessels and runneth out it silfe and the vessels perisshe:
042	LUK	005	038	But newe wyne must be poured into newe vessels and bothe are preserved.
042	LUK	005	039	Also no man yt drinketh olde wine strayght waye can awaye with newe for he sayeth ye olde is plesauter.
042	LUK	006	001	It happened on an after saboth that he went thorow the corne felde and that his disciples plucked the eares of corne and ate and rubbed them in their hondes.
042	LUK	006	002	And certayne of the Pharises sayde vnto them: Why do ye that which is not laufull to do on the saboth dayes?
042	LUK	006	003	And Iesus answered them and sayde: Have ye not redde what David dyd when he him sylfe was anhungred and they which were with him:
042	LUK	006	004	how he went into the housse of God and toke and ate the loves of halowed breed and gave also to them which were with him: which was not laufull to eate but for the prestes only.
042	LUK	006	005	And he sayde vnto them: The sonne of man is Lorde of the saboth daye.
042	LUK	006	006	And it fortuned in a nother saboth also that he entred in to ye sinagoge and taught.  And ther was a ma whose right honde was dryed vp.
042	LUK	006	007	And ye Scribes and Pharises watched him to se whether he wolde heale on the Saboth daye that they myght fynde an accusacion agaynst him.
042	LUK	006	008	But he knewe their thoughtes and sayde to the man which had ye wyddred honde: Ryse vp and stonde forthe in the myddes.  And he arose and stepped forthe.
042	LUK	006	009	Then sayde Iesus vnto them: I will axe you a question: Whether is it laufull on the saboth dayes to do good or to do evill?  to save lyfe or for to destroye it?
042	LUK	006	010	And he behelde them all in copasse and sayd vnto ye man: Stretche forth thy honde.  And he dyd so and his honde was restored and made as whoole as the other.
042	LUK	006	011	And they were filled full of madnes and comuned one with another what they myght do to Iesu.
042	LUK	006	012	And it fortuned in thoose dayes that he went out into a mountayne for to praye and cotinued all nyght in prayer to god.
042	LUK	006	013	And assone as it was daye he called his disciples and of the he chose twelve which also he called apostles.
042	LUK	006	014	Simon who he named Peter: and Andrew his brother.  Iames and Iho Philip and Bartlemew
042	LUK	006	015	Mathew and Thomas Iames the sonne of Alpheus and Simon called zelotes
042	LUK	006	016	and Iudas Iames sonne and Iudas Iscarioth which same was the traytour.
042	LUK	006	017	And he came doune with them and stode in the playne felde with the company of his disciples and agreate multitude of people out of all parties of Iurie and Ierusalem and from the see cooste of Tire and Sidon which came to heare hym and to be healed of their diseases:
042	LUK	006	018	and they also that were vexed with foule spretes and they were healed.
042	LUK	006	019	And all the people preased to touche him: for there went vertue out of him and healed them all.
042	LUK	006	020	And he lifted vp his eyes apon the disciples and sayde: Blessed be ye poore: for yours is the kyngdome of God.
042	LUK	006	021	Blessed are ye that honger now: for ye shalbe satisfied.  Blessed are ye yt wepe now: for ye shall laugh.
042	LUK	006	022	Blessed are ye when men hate you and thrust you oute of their companye and rayle and abhorre youre name as an evyll thinge for the sonne of manes sake.
042	LUK	006	023	Reioyse ye then and be gladde: for beholde youre rewarde is greate in heven.  After this manner their fathers entreated the Prophetes.
042	LUK	006	024	But wo be to you that are ryche: for ye have therin youre consolacion.
042	LUK	006	025	Wo be to you yt are full: for ye shall honger.  Wo be to you that now laugh: for ye shall wayle and wepe.
042	LUK	006	026	Wo be to you when all men prayse you: for so dyd their fathers to the false prophetes.
042	LUK	006	027	But I saye vnto you which heare: Love youre enemyes.  Do good to the which hate you.
042	LUK	006	028	Blesse the that course you.  And praye for the which wrongfully trouble you.
042	LUK	006	029	And vnto him that smyteth the on the one cheke offer also ye other.  And him that taketh awaye thy goune forbid not to take thy coote also.
042	LUK	006	030	Geve to every man that axeth of the.  And of him that taketh awaye thy goodes axe them not agayne.
042	LUK	006	031	And as ye wolde that men shuld doo to you: so do ye to them lyke wyse.
042	LUK	006	032	If ye love the which love you: what thanke are ye worthy of?  For the very synners love their lovers.
042	LUK	006	033	And yf ye do for them which do for you: what thanke are ye worthy of?  For the very synners do even the same.
042	LUK	006	034	If ye lende to them of whome ye hoope to receave: what thanke shall ye have: for the very synners lende to synners to receave as moch agayne.
042	LUK	006	035	Wherfore love ye youre enemys do good and lende lokynge for nothinge agayne and youre rewarde shalbe greate and ye shalbe the chyldren of the hyest: for he is kynde vnto the vnkynde and to the evyll.
042	LUK	006	036	Be ye therfore mercifull as youre father is mercifull.
042	LUK	006	037	Iudge not and ye shall not be Iudged.  Condemne not: and ye shall not be condemned.  Forgeve and ye shalbe forgeven.
042	LUK	006	038	Geve and yt shalbe geven vnto you: good measure pressed doune shaken to geder and runnynge over shall men geve into youre bosomes.  For with what measure ye mete with ye same shall men mete to you agayne.
042	LUK	006	039	And he put forthe a similitude vnto the: Can the blynde leade ye blynde?  Do they not both then fall into ye dyche?
042	LUK	006	040	The disciple is not above his master.  Every ma shalbe perfecte even as his master is.
042	LUK	006	041	Why seyst thou a moote in thy brothers eye considerest not ye beame yt is in thyne awne eye?
042	LUK	006	042	Ether how canest thou saye to thy brother: Brother let me pull out ye moote that is in thyne eye: when thou perceavest not the beame that is in thyne awne eye?  Ypocrite cast out ye beame out of thyne awne eye fyrst and then shalt thou se perfectly to pull out the moote out of thy brothers eye.
042	LUK	006	043	It is not a good tree that bringeth forthe evyll frute: nether is that an evyll tree that bringeth forthe good frute
042	LUK	006	044	For every tree is knowen by his frute.  Nether of thornes gader men fygges nor of busshes gader they grapes.
042	LUK	006	045	A good man out of the good treasure of his hert bringeth forthe that which is good.  And an evyll man out of the evyll treasure of his hert bringeth forthe that which ys evyll.  For of the aboundaunce of ye her his mouthe speakethe.
042	LUK	006	046	Why call ye me Master Master: and do not as I bid you?
042	LUK	006	047	whosoever cometh to me and heareth my sayinges and dothe the same I will shewe you to whome he ys lyke.
042	LUK	006	048	He is like a man which bilt an housse: and digged depe and layde the foundacio on a rocke.  Whe the waters arose the fludde bet apo that housse and coulde not move yt.  For it was grounded apon a rocke.
042	LUK	006	049	But he that heareth and doth not is lyke a man that with out foundacion bylt an housse apon the erth agaynst which the fludde did bet: and it fell by and by.  And ye fall of yt housse was greate.
042	LUK	007	001	When he had ended all his sainges in the audience of the people he entred into Capernau
042	LUK	007	002	And a certayne Centurions seruaunte was sicke and redy to dye whom he made moche of.
042	LUK	007	003	And when he hearde of Iesu he sent vnto him the elders of the Iewes besechinge him yt he wolde come and heale his servaunt.
042	LUK	007	004	And they came to Iesus and besought him instantly sayinge: He is worthi that thou shuldest do this for him.
042	LUK	007	005	For he loveth oure nacion and hath bilt vs a sinagoge
042	LUK	007	006	And Iesus went with them.  And when he was not farre fro the housse the Centurio sent frendes to him sayinge vnto him: Lorde trouble not thy silfe: for I am not worthy yt thou shuldest enter vnder my roffe.
042	LUK	007	007	Wherfore I thought not my silfe worthy to come vnto the: but saye the worde and my servaunt shalbe whoole.
042	LUK	007	008	For I lyke wyse am a man vnder power and have vnder me soudiers and I saye vnto won goo: and he goeth.  And to another come: and he cometh.  And to my servaunt do this: and he doeth it.
042	LUK	007	009	When Iesus herde this he merveyled at him and turned him about and sayd to the people that folowed him: I saye vnto you I have not founde so greate faith noo not in Israel.
042	LUK	007	010	And they yt were sent turned backe home agayne and founde the servaunt that was sicke whoole.
042	LUK	007	011	And it fortuned after that that he went into a cite called Naim and many of his disciples went wt him and moche people.
042	LUK	007	012	When he came nye to the gate of the cite: beholde ther was a deed man caried out which was ye only sonne of his mother and she was a widowe and moche people of the cite was with her.
042	LUK	007	013	And when ye lorde sawe her he had compassion on her and sayde vnto her: wepe not.
042	LUK	007	014	And he went and touched the coffyn and they yt bare him stode still.  And he sayde: Yonge man I saye vnto the aryse.
042	LUK	007	015	And ye deed sate vp and beganne to speake.  And he delyvered him to his mother.
042	LUK	007	016	And ther ca a feare on the all.  And they glorified god sayinge: a greate prophet is rysen amoge vs and god hath visited his people
042	LUK	007	017	And this rumor of him wet forthe throughout all Iurie and thorowout all the regions which lye rounde about.
042	LUK	007	018	And ye disciples of Iohn shewed him of all these thinges.
042	LUK	007	019	And Iohn called vnto him. ii.  of his disciples and sent the to Iesus sayinge: Arte thou he that shall come: or shall we loke for another?
042	LUK	007	020	When the men were come vnto him they sayde: Iohn baptiste sent vs vnto ye sayinge: Arte thou he that shall come: or shall we wayte for another?
042	LUK	007	021	And at yt same tyme he cured many of their infirmites and plages and of evyll spretes and vnto many that were blynde he gave sight
042	LUK	007	022	And Iesus answered and sayd vnto them: Goo youre wayes and shewe Iohn what thinges ye have sene and harde: how yt the blynde se the halt goo the lepers are clensed the deafe heare the deed aryse to the poore is the glad tydinges preached
042	LUK	007	023	and happy is he that is not offended by me.
042	LUK	007	024	When ye messengers of Iohn were departed he began to speake vnto ye people of Iohn What wet ye oute into ye wildernes for to se?  went ye to se arede shaken wt ye wynde?
042	LUK	007	025	But what went ye out for tose?  A ma clothed in soofte rayment?  Beholde they which are gorgeously apparelled and lyve delicatly are in kynges courtes.
042	LUK	007	026	But what went ye forth to se?  A prophete?  Ye I saye to you and moare then a prophete
042	LUK	007	027	This is he of who it is wrytte: Beholde I sende my messenger before thy face to prepare thy waye before the.
042	LUK	007	028	For I saye vnto you: a greater prophete then Iohn amoge wemes chyldre is ther none.  Neverthelesse one yt is lesse in ye kyngdo of god is greater the he
042	LUK	007	029	And all the people that hearde and the publicans iustified God and were baptised with the baptim of Iohn.
042	LUK	007	030	But the pharises and scribes despised ye counsell of god agaynst them selves and were not baptised of him.
042	LUK	007	031	And ye lorde sayd: Wher vnto shall I lyke the men of this generacion and what thinge are they lyke?
042	LUK	007	032	They are lyke vnto chyldre sittynge in ye market place and cryinge one to another and sayinge: We have pyped vnto you and ye hahave not daunsed: we have mourned to you and ye have not wept.
042	LUK	007	033	For Iohn baptist cam nether eatynge breed ner drinkynge wyne and ye saye: he hath the devyll.
042	LUK	007	034	The sonne of man is come and eateth and drinketh and ye saye: beholde a man which is a glotton and a drinker of wyne a frende of publicans and synners.
042	LUK	007	035	Yet is wysdome iustified of all her chyldren.
042	LUK	007	036	And one of the pharises desyred him that he wolde eate with him.  And he went into ye pharises housse and sate doune to meate.
042	LUK	007	037	And beholde a woman in that cite which was a synner assone as she knewe that.  Iesus sate at meate in the pharises housse she brought an alablaster boxe of oyntmet
042	LUK	007	038	and she stode at his fete behynde him wepynge and beganne to wesshe his fete with teares and dyd wipe the with the heares of her heed and kyssed his fete and anoynted them with oyntment.
042	LUK	007	039	When the pharise which bade him sawe that he spake with in him sylfe sayinge: If this man were a prophete he wolde surely have knowen who and what maner woman this is which toucheth him for she is a synner.
042	LUK	007	040	And Iesus answered and sayde vnto him: Simon I have some what to saye vnto ye.  And he sayd master saye on.
042	LUK	007	041	There was a certayne lender which had two detters ye one ought five hondred pence and the other fyfty.
042	LUK	007	042	When they had nothinge to paye he forgave the boothe.  Which of them tell me will love him moost?
042	LUK	007	043	Simon answered and sayde: I suppose that he to whom he forgave moost.  And he sayde vnto him: Thou hast truly iudged.
042	LUK	007	044	And he turned to the woman and sayde vnto Simon: Seist thou this woman?  I entred into thy housse and thou gavest me noo water to my fete but she hath wesshed my fete with teares and wiped the with the heeres of her heed.
042	LUK	007	045	Thou gavest me no kysse: but she sence ye tyme I came in hath not ceased to kysse my fete
042	LUK	007	046	Myne heed wt oyle thou dydest not anoynte: but she hath annoynted my fete wt oyntmet.
042	LUK	007	047	Wherefore I saye vnto the: many synnes are forgeve her for she loved moche.  To whom lesse is forgeven the same doeth lesse love.
042	LUK	007	048	And he sayde vnto her thy synnes are forgeven ye
042	LUK	007	049	And they yt sate at meate with him beganne to saye within them selves: Who is this which forgeveth synnes also?
042	LUK	007	050	And he sayde to ye woman: Thy faith hath saved the Goo in peace.
042	LUK	008	001	And it fortuned after that that he him sylfe went throughout cities and tounes preachynge and shewinge ye kyngdom of God and the twelve with him.
042	LUK	008	002	And also certayne wemen which wer healed of evell spretes and infirmities: Mary called Magdalen out of whom went seven devyls
042	LUK	008	003	and Ioanna ye wyfe of Chusa Herodees stewarde and Susanna and many other: which ministred vnto the of their substaunce.
042	LUK	008	004	When moch people were gadred to gether and were come to him out of all cities he spake by a similitude.
042	LUK	008	005	A sower went out to sowe his seede: and as he sowed some fell by the waye syde and it was troden vnder fete and the foules of the ayre devoured it vp.
042	LUK	008	006	And some fell on ston and assone as it was spronge vp it widdred awaye because it lacked moystnes.
042	LUK	008	007	And some fell amonge thornes and ye thornes spronge vp with it and choked it.
042	LUK	008	008	And some fell on good grounde and sproge vp and bare frute an hondred foolde.  And as he sayde these thinges he cryed: He that hath eares to heare let him heare.
042	LUK	008	009	And his disciples axed him sayinge: what maner similitude is this?
042	LUK	008	010	And he sayde: vnto you is it geven to knowe the secretes of the kyngdom of God: but to other in similitudes that when they se they shuld not se: and when they heare they shuld not vnderstonde.
042	LUK	008	011	The similitude is this.  The seede is ye worde of God.
042	LUK	008	012	Thoose yt are besyde the waye are they that heare and afterwarde cometh ye devyll and taketh awaye the worde out of their hertes lest they shuld beleve and be saved.
042	LUK	008	013	They on the stonnes are they which when they heare receave the worde with ioye.  But these have noo rootes which for a whyle beleve and in tyme of temtacio goo awaye.
042	LUK	008	014	And yt which fell amonge thornes are they which heare and goo forth and are choked wt cares and wt riches and volupteous lyvinge and bringe forth noo frute.
042	LUK	008	015	That in ye good grounde are they which with a good and pure hert heare the worde and kepe it and bringe forth frute with pacience.
042	LUK	008	016	No man lyghteth a candell and covereth it vnder a vessell nether putteth it vnder ye table: but setteth it on a candelsticke that they that enter in maye se ye lyght.
042	LUK	008	017	No thinge is in secret yt shall not come abroode: Nether eny thinge hyd that shall not be knowen and come to lyght.
042	LUK	008	018	Take hede therfore how ye heare.  For whosoever hath to him shalbe geve: And whosoever hath not fro him shalbe take even that same which he supposeth that he hath.
042	LUK	008	019	Then came to him his mother and his brethren and coulde not come at him for prease.
042	LUK	008	020	And they tolde him sayinge: Thy mother and thy brethren stonde with out and wolde se the.
042	LUK	008	021	He answered and sayd vnto them: my mother and my brethren are these which heare the worde of God and do it.
042	LUK	008	022	And it chaunsed on a certayne daye that he went into a shippe and his disciples also and he sayde vnto them: Let vs goo over vnto the other syde of the lake.  And they Lanched forthe.
042	LUK	008	023	And as they sayled he fell a slepe and there arose a storme of wynde in ye lake and they were fylled with water and were in ieopardy.
042	LUK	008	024	And they went to him and awoke him sayinge: Master Master we are loost.  Then he arose and rebuked the wynde and the tempest of water and they ceased and it wexed calme.
042	LUK	008	025	And he sayd vnto the: where is youre faith?  They feared and wondred sayinge one to another: what felowe is this?  for he comaundeth bothe the wyndes and water and they obey him?
042	LUK	008	026	And they sayled vnto the region of ye Gaderenites which is over agaynst Galile.
042	LUK	008	027	And as he went out to londe ther met him a certayne man out of ye cite which had a devyll longe tyme and ware noo clothes nether aboode in eny housse: but amonge graves.
042	LUK	008	028	When he sawe Iesus he cryed and fell doune before him and with a loude voyce sayde: What have I to do with the Iesus the sonne of the God moost hyest?  I beseche the torment me not.
042	LUK	008	029	Then he comaunded ye foule sprete to come out of the man.  For ofte tymes he caught him and he was bounde with chaynes and kept with fetters: and he brake the bondes and was caryed of the fende into wyldernes.
042	LUK	008	030	And Iesus axed him sayinge: what is thy name?  And he sayde: Legion because many devyls were entred into him.
042	LUK	008	031	And they besought him yt he wolde not comaunde the to goo out into ye depe.
042	LUK	008	032	And ther was there by an heerde of many swyne fedynge on an hyll: and they besought him yt he wolde soffre the to enter into the.  And he soffred the.
042	LUK	008	033	Then went the devyls out of the man and entred into the swyne: And the heerd toke their course and ran heedlynge into the lake and were choked.
042	LUK	008	034	When the herdmen sawe what had chaunsed they fleed and tolde it in the cite and in the villages.
042	LUK	008	035	And they came out to se what was done: and came to Iesus and founde ye man out of who the devyls were departed sittynge at the fete of Iesus clothed and in his right mynde and they were afrayde.
042	LUK	008	036	They also wich sawe it tolde the by what meanes he yt was possessed of ye devyll was healed.
042	LUK	008	037	And all the whole multitude of ye cotrye of the Gaderenites besought him yt he wolde departe from the: for they were taken wt greate feare.  And he gate him into the shippe and returned backe agayne.
042	LUK	008	038	Then the man out of whom the devyls were departed besought him yt he myght be wt him: But Iesus sent him awaye sayinge:
042	LUK	008	039	Goo home agayne into thyne awne housse and shewe what great thinges God hath done to ye.  And he went his waye and preached thorow out all the cite what great thinges Iesus had done vnto him.
042	LUK	008	040	And it fortuned when Iesus was come agayne that ye people receaved him.  For they all wayted for him.
042	LUK	008	041	And beholde ther came a man named Iairus (and he was a ruler of ye synagoge) and he fell doune at Iesus fete and besought him yt he wolde come into his housse
042	LUK	008	042	for he had but a doughter only apon a twelve yere of age and she laye a dyinge.  And as he went the people thronged him.
042	LUK	008	043	And a woman havynge an issue of bloud twelve yeres (which had spent all her substance amonge phisicios nether coulde be holpen of eny)
042	LUK	008	044	came behinde him and touched the hem of his garmet and immediatly her issue of bloud staunched.
042	LUK	008	045	And Iesus sayde: Who is it that touched me?  when every man denyed Peter and they yt were with him sayde: Master the people thrust the and vexe the: and sayest thou who touched me?
042	LUK	008	046	And Iesus sayd: Some body touched me.  For I perceave that vertue is gone out of me.
042	LUK	008	047	When the woman sawe that she was not hid she came trimblynge and fell at is fete and tolde him before all the people for what cause she had touched him and how she was healed immediatly.
042	LUK	008	048	And he sayde vnto hyr: Doughter be of good comforte Thy faith hath made the hoale goo in peace.
042	LUK	008	049	Whyll he yet spake there came one from ye rulers of the synagogis housse which sayde to him: thy doughter is deed disease not the master.
042	LUK	008	050	When Iesus hearde that He answered the father sayinge: Feare not beleve only and she shalbe made whole.
042	LUK	008	051	And when he came to ye housse he suffred no man to goo in with him save Peter Iames and Iohn and the father and the mother of the mayden.
042	LUK	008	052	Every body weept and sorowed for her.  And he sayde: Wepe not: for she is not deed but slepeth.
042	LUK	008	053	And they lewgh him to scorne.  For they knew that she was deed.
042	LUK	008	054	And he thrust the all out and caught her by the honde and cryed sayinge: Mayde aryse.
042	LUK	008	055	And hyr sprete came agayne and she roose strayght waye.  And he commaunded to geve her meate.
042	LUK	008	056	And the father and the mother of hyr were astonyed.  But he warned the that they shuld tell noo man what was done.
042	LUK	009	001	Then called he the. xii.  to gether and gave them power and auctorite over all devyls and that they myght heale diseases.
042	LUK	009	002	And he sent them to preache the kyngdome of God and to cure the sick.
042	LUK	009	003	And he sayd to them: Take nothinge to sucker you by ye waye: nether staffe nor scripe nether breed nether money nether have twoo cootes.
042	LUK	009	004	And whatsoever housse ye enter into there abyde and thence departe.
042	LUK	009	005	And whosoever will not receave you when ye go out of that cite shake of the very dust from youre fete for a testimony agaynst them.
042	LUK	009	006	And they went out and went thorow the tounes preachinge the gospell and healynge every wheare.
042	LUK	009	007	And Herod the tetrarch herde of all that was done of him and douted because that it was sayde of some that Iohn was rysen agayne from deeth:
042	LUK	009	008	and of some that Helyas had apered: and of other that one of the olde prophetes was rysen agayne.
042	LUK	009	009	And Herod sayde: Iohn have I behedded: who then is this of whom I heare suche thinges?  And he desyred to se him.
042	LUK	009	010	And the Apostles retourned and tolde him what great thinges they had done.  And he toke them and went a syde into a solitary place nye to a citie called Bethsaida.
042	LUK	009	011	And ye people knewe of it and folowed him.  And he receaved them and spake vnto them of the kyngdome of God and healed them that had nede to be healed.
042	LUK	009	012	And when ye daye beganne to weare awaye then came the twelve and sayde vnto him: sende ye people awaye that they maye goo into the tounes and villages roundabout and lodge and get meate for we are here in a place of wyldernes.
042	LUK	009	013	But he sayde vnto them: Geve ye the to eate.  And they sayde.  We have no moo but fyve loves and two fisshes except we shuld goo and bye meate for all this people.
042	LUK	009	014	And they were about a fyve thousand men.  And he sayde to his disciples: Cause them to syt doune by fyfties in a company.
042	LUK	009	015	And they dyd soo and made them all syt doune.
042	LUK	009	016	And he toke the fyve loves and the two fisshes and loked vp to heven and blessed them and brake and gave to the disciples to set before ye people.
042	LUK	009	017	And they ate and were all satisfied.  And ther was taken vp of that remayned to the twelve baskettes full of broken meate.
042	LUK	009	018	And it fortuned as he was alone prayinge his disciples were wt him and he axed the sayinge: Who saye ye people yt I am?
042	LUK	009	019	They answered and sayd: Iohn Baptist.  Some saye Helyas.  And some saye one of the olde prophetes is rysen agayne.
042	LUK	009	020	He sayde vnto the: Who saye ye that I am?  Peter answered and sayde: thou arte the Christ of god.
042	LUK	009	021	And he warned and commaunded them that they shuld tell no man yt thinge
042	LUK	009	022	sayinge: that the sonne of man must suffre many thinges and be reproved of the elders and of the hye prestes and scribes and be slayne and the thirde daye ryse agayne.
042	LUK	009	023	And he sayde to them all yf eny man will come after me let him denye him sylfe and take vp his crosse dayly and folowe me.
042	LUK	009	024	Whosoever will save his lyfe shall lose it.  And who soever shall lose his lyfe for my sake the same shall save it.
042	LUK	009	025	For what avauntageth it a man to wynne the whole worlde yf he loose him sylfe or runne in domage of him sylfe?
042	LUK	009	026	For whosoever is ashamed of me and of my sayinges: of him shall the sonne of man be ashamed when he cometh in his awne glorie and in the glorie of his father and of the holy angels.
042	LUK	009	027	And I tell you of a surety: There be some of the yt stonde here which shall not tast of deeth tyll they se ye kyngdome of god.
042	LUK	009	028	And it folowed about an. viii.  dayes after thoose sayinges that he toke Peter Iames and Iohn and went vp into a moutayne to praye.
042	LUK	009	029	And as he prayed ye facion of his countenaunce was changed and his garment was whyte and shoone.
042	LUK	009	030	And beholde two men talked wt him and they were Moses and Helyas
042	LUK	009	031	which appered gloriously and spake of his departinge which he shuld ende at Ierusalem.
042	LUK	009	032	Peter and they that were with him were hevy with slepe.  And when they woke they sawe his glorie and two men stondinge with him.
042	LUK	009	033	And it chaunsed as they departed fro him Peter sayde vnto Iesus: Master it is good beinge here for vs.  Let vs make thre tabernacles one for the and one for Moses and one for Helyas: and wist not what he sayde.
042	LUK	009	034	Whyll he thus spake ther came a cloude and shadowed them: and they feared when they were come vnder the cloude.
042	LUK	009	035	And ther came a voyce out of the cloude sayinge: This is my deare sonne heare him.
042	LUK	009	036	And assone as ye voyce was past Iesus was founde alone.  And they kept it cloose and tolde noo man in thoose dayes eny of those thinges which they had sene.
042	LUK	009	037	And it chaunsed on the nexte daye as they came doune from the hyll moche people met him.
042	LUK	009	038	And beholde a man of the copany cryed out sayinge: Master I beseche ye beholde my sonne for he is all that I have:
042	LUK	009	039	and se a sprete taketh him and sodenly he cryeth and he teareth him that he fometh agayne and with moche payne departeth fro him when he hath rent him and
042	LUK	009	040	I besought thy disciples to cast him out and they coulde not.
042	LUK	009	041	Iesus answered and sayde: O generacion with oute fayth and croked: how longe shall I be with you?  and shall suffre you?  Bringe thy sonne hidder.
042	LUK	009	042	As he yet was a cominge the fende ret him and tare him.  And Iesus rebuked ye vnclene sprete and healed the childe and delivered him to his father.
042	LUK	009	043	And they were all amased at ye mighty power of God.  Whyll they wondred every one at all thinges which he dyd he sayd vnto his disciples:
042	LUK	009	044	Let these sayinges synke doune into youre eares.  The tyme will come when the sonne of man shalbe delivered into the hondes of men.
042	LUK	009	045	But they wist not what yt worde meant and yt was hyd fro the that they vnderstode yt not.  And they feared to axe him of that sayinge.
042	LUK	009	046	Then ther arose a disputacion amoge the: who shuld be the greatest.
042	LUK	009	047	When Iesus perceaved ye thoughtes of their hertes he toke a chylde and set him hard by him
042	LUK	009	048	and sayd vnto the: Whosoever receaveth this chylde in my name receaveth me.  And whosoever receaveth me receaveth him yt sent me.  For he yt is least amonge you all the same shalbe greate.
042	LUK	009	049	And Iohn answered and sayde: Master we sawe one castinge out devyls in thy name and we forbade him because he foloweth not with vs.
042	LUK	009	050	And Iesus sayde vnto him: forbyd ye him not.  For he that is not agaynst vs is wt vs.
042	LUK	009	051	And it folowed when the tyme was come yt he shulde be receaved vp then he set his face to goo to Hierusalem
042	LUK	009	052	and sent messengers before him.  And they went and entred into a citie of the Samaritans to make redy for him.
042	LUK	009	053	But they wolde not receave him be cause his face was as though he wolde goo to Ierusalem.
042	LUK	009	054	When his disciples Iames and Iohn sawe yt they sayde: Lorde wilt thou that we comaunde that fyre come doune from heven and consume them even as Helias dyd?
042	LUK	009	055	Iesus turned about and rebuked them sayinge: ye wote not what maner sprete ye are of.
042	LUK	009	056	The sonne of ma ys not come to destroye mennes lives but to save them.  And they went to another toune.
042	LUK	009	057	And it chaunsed as he went in the waye a certayne man sayd vnto him: I will folowe the whither soever thou goo.
042	LUK	009	058	Iesus sayd vnto him: foxes have holes and bryddes of ye ayer have nestes: but the sonne of man hath not where on to laye his heed.
042	LUK	009	059	And he sayde vnto another: folowe me.  And the same sayde: Lorde suffre me fyrst to goo and bury my father.
042	LUK	009	060	Iesus sayd vnto him: Let the deed bury their deed: but goo thou and preache the kyngdome of God.
042	LUK	009	061	And another sayde: I wyll folowe the Lorde: but let me fyrst goo byd them fare well which are at home at my housse.
042	LUK	009	062	Iesus sayde vnto him: No man that putteth his honde to the plowe and loketh backe is apte to the kyngdome of God.
042	LUK	010	001	After these thinges the Lorde apoynted other seventie also and sent them two and two before him into every citie and place whither he him silfe wolde come.
042	LUK	010	002	And he sayde vnto them the harvest is greate: but the laborers are feawe.  Praye therfore the Lorde of ye harvest to send forth laborers into his hervest.
042	LUK	010	003	Goo youre wayes: beholde I sende you forthe as lambes amonge wolves.
042	LUK	010	004	Beare noo wallet nether scryppe nor shues and salute noo man by the waye.
042	LUK	010	005	Into whatsoever housse ye enter fyrst saye: Peace be to this housse.
042	LUK	010	006	And yf ye sonne of peace be theare youre peace shall rest vpon him: yf not yt shall returne to you agayne.
042	LUK	010	007	And in ye same housse tary still eatinge and drinkinge soche as they have.  For the laborer is worthy of his ewarde.  Go not fro housse to housse:
042	LUK	010	008	and in to whatso ever citye ye enter yf they receave you eate soche thinges as are set before you
042	LUK	010	009	and heale the sicke yt are theare and saye vnto them: the kyngdome of God is come nye vpon you.
042	LUK	010	010	But into whatsoever citie ye shall enter yf they receave you not goo youre wayes out into the stretes of ye same and saye:
042	LUK	010	011	even the very dust which cleaveth on vs of your citie we wipe of agaynst you: Not withstondinge marke this that ye kyngdome of God was come nie vpon you.
042	LUK	010	012	Ye and I saye vnto you: that it shalbe easier in that daye for Sodom then for yt cytie.
042	LUK	010	013	Wo be to the Chorazin: wo be to ye Bethsaida.  For yf ye miracles had bene done in Tyre and Sido which have bene done in you they had a greate whyle agone repeted sitting in heere and asshes.
042	LUK	010	014	Neverthelesse it shalbe easier for Tyre and Sidon at the iudgement then for you.
042	LUK	010	015	And thou Capernau which art exalted to heave shalt be thrust doune to hell.
042	LUK	010	016	He yt heareth you heareth me: and he that dispiseth you despiseth me: and he that dispiseth me despiseth him that sent me.
042	LUK	010	017	And the sevetie returned agayne with ioye sayinge: Lorde even the very devyls are subdued to vs thorowe thy name.
042	LUK	010	018	And he sayde vnto them: I sawe satan as it had bene lightenyng faule doune fro heave.
042	LUK	010	019	Beholde I geve vnto you power to treade on serpetes and scorpions and over all maner power of the enimye and no thinge shall hurte you.
042	LUK	010	020	Neverthelesse in this reioyse not that ye spretes are vnder youre power: but reioyse be cause youre names are wrytten in heaven.
042	LUK	010	021	That same tyme reioysed Iesus in ye sprete and sayde: I confesse vnto ye father Lorde of heaven and erth yt thou hast hyd these thynges from the wyse and prudent and hast opened them to the babes.  Even so father for soo pleased it the.
042	LUK	010	022	All thinges are geven me of my father.  And no man knoweth who the sonne is but the father: nether who the father is save the sonne and he to who the sonne wyll shewe him.
042	LUK	010	023	And he turned to his disciples and sayde secretly: Happy are ye eyes which se yt ye se.
042	LUK	010	024	For I tell you that many prophetes and kynges have desired to se those thinges which ye se and have not sene them: and to heare those thinges which ye heare and have not hearde them.
042	LUK	010	025	And beholde a certayne Lawere stode vp and tempted him sayinge: Master what shall I do to inheret eternall life?
042	LUK	010	026	He sayd vnto him: What is written in the lawe?  How redest thou?
042	LUK	010	027	And he answered and sayde: Loue thy Lorde God with all thy hert and with all thy soule and with all thy stregthe and with all thy mynde: and thy neghbour as thy sylfe.
042	LUK	010	028	And he sayde vnto him: Thou hast answered right.  This do and thou shalt live.
042	LUK	010	029	He willinge to iustifie him silfe sayde vnto Iesus: Who is then my neghbour?
042	LUK	010	030	Iesus answered and sayde: A certayne ma descended fro Hierusalem into Hierico and fell in to the hondes of theves which robbed him of his raymet and wounded him and departed levynge him halfe deed.
042	LUK	010	031	And by chaunce ther came a certayne preste that same waye and when he sawe him he passed by.
042	LUK	010	032	And lykewyse a Levite when he was come nye to the place wet and loked on him and passed by.
042	LUK	010	033	Then a certayne Samaritane as he iornyed came nye vnto him and when he sawe him had compassion on him
042	LUK	010	034	and went to and bounde vp his woundes and poured in oyle and wyne and put him on his awne beaste and brought him to a comen ynne and made provision for him.
042	LUK	010	035	And on the morowe when he departed he toke out two pece and gave them to the host and sayde vnto him.  Take cure of him and whatsoever thou spedest moare when I come agayne I will recompence the.
042	LUK	010	036	Which now of these thre thynkest thou was neighbour vnto him yt fell into ye theves hondes?
042	LUK	010	037	And he sayde: he that shewed mercy on him.  Then sayde Iesus vnto him.  Goo and do thou lyke wyse.
042	LUK	010	038	It fortuned as they wet that he entred in to a certayne toune.  And a certayne woman named Martha receaved him into her housse.
042	LUK	010	039	And this woman had a sister called Mary which sate at Iesus fete and hearde his preachinge.
042	LUK	010	040	And Martha was combred about moche servinge and stode and sayde: Master doest thou not care that my sister hath leeft me to minister alone?  Byd her therfore that she helpe me.
042	LUK	010	041	And Iesus answered and sayde vnto her: Martha Martha thou carest and arte troubled about many thinges:
042	LUK	010	042	verely one is nedfull.  Mary hath chosen her that good parte which shall not be taken awaye from her.
042	LUK	011	001	And it fortuned as he was prayinge in a certayne place: when he ceased one of his disciples sayde vnto him: Master teache vs to praye as Iohn taught his disciples.
042	LUK	011	002	And he sayd vnto the: When ye praye saye: O oure father which arte in heave halowed be thy name.  Thy kyngdome come.  Thy will be fulfilled even in erth as it is in heaven.
042	LUK	011	003	Oure dayly breed geve vs evermore.
042	LUK	011	004	And forgeve vs oure synnes: For eve we forgeve every man yt treaspaseth vs.  And ledde vs not into teptacio.  But deliver vs fro evill.
042	LUK	011	005	And he sayde vnto them: if any of you shuld have a frede and shuld goo to him at mid nyght and saye vnto him: frende lende me thre loves
042	LUK	011	006	for a frende of myne is come out of the waye to me and I have nothinge to set before him:
042	LUK	011	007	and he within shuld answere and saye trouble me not the dore is now sheet and my servautes are with me in the chamber I canot ryse and geve them to the.
042	LUK	011	008	I saye vnto you though he wold not aryse and geve him because he is his frede: yet because of his importunite he wold rise and geve him as many as he neded.
042	LUK	011	009	And I saye vnto you: axe and it shalbe geven you.  Seke and ye shall fynde.  knocke and it shalbe opened vnto you.
042	LUK	011	010	For every one that axeth receaveth: and he that seketh fyndeth: and to him that knocketh shall it be openned.
042	LUK	011	011	Yf the sonne shall axe breed of eny of you that is a father: wyll he geve him a stone?  Or yf he axe fisshe wyll he for a fysshe geve him a serpent?
042	LUK	011	012	Or yf he axe an egge: wyll he offer him a scorpion?
042	LUK	011	013	Yf ye then which are evyll canne geve good giftes vnto youre chyldren how moche more shall the father of heaven geve an holy sprete to them that desyre it of him?
042	LUK	011	014	And he was a castynge out a devyll which was dome.  And it folowed when the devyll was gone out the domme spake and the people wondred.
042	LUK	011	015	But some of the sayde: he casteth out devyls by the power of Belzebub the chefe of the devyls.
042	LUK	011	016	And other tempted him sekinge of him a signe fro heave.
042	LUK	011	017	But he knewe their thoughtes and sayde vnto them: Every kingdome devided with in it silfe shalbe desolate: and one housse shall fall vpon another.
042	LUK	011	018	So if Satan be devided with in him silfe: how shall his kyngdome endure?  Because ye saye that I cast out devyls by the power of Belzebub.
042	LUK	011	019	Yf I by the power of Belzebub caste oute devyls: by whome do youre chyldren cast them out?  Therfore shall they be youre iudges.
042	LUK	011	020	But if I with ye finger of God cast out devyls noo doute the kyngdome of God is come vpon you.
042	LUK	011	021	When a stronge man armed watcheth his housse: yt he possesseth is in peace.
042	LUK	011	022	But when a stronger then he cometh vpo him and overcometh him: he taketh from him his harnes wherin he trusted and devideth his gooddes.
042	LUK	011	023	He that is not with me is agaynst me.  And he that gadereth not with me scattereth.
042	LUK	011	024	When the vnclene sprete is gone out of a man he walketh through waterlesse places sekinge reest.  And when he fyndeth none he sayeth: I will returne agayne vnto my housse whence I came out.
042	LUK	011	025	And when he cometh he fyndeth it swept and garnissed.
042	LUK	011	026	Then goeth he and taketh to him seve other spretes worsse then himsilfe: and they enter in and dwell there.  And the ende of that man is worsse then the begynninge.
042	LUK	011	027	And it fortuned as he spake those thinges a certayne woman of the copany lyfte vp her voyce and sayde vnto him: Happy is the wombe that bare the and the pappes which gave the sucke.
042	LUK	011	028	But he sayde: Ye happy are they that heare the worde of God and kepe it.
042	LUK	011	029	When the people were gadered thicke to geder: he began to saye.  This is an evyll nacion: they seke a signe and ther shall no signe be geven them but the signe of Ionas the Prophet.
042	LUK	011	030	For as Ionas was a signe to the Ninivites so shall ye sonne of ma be to this nacio.
042	LUK	011	031	The quene of the southe shall ryse at iudgement with the men of this generacio and condempne them: for she came fro the ende of the worlde to heare the wysdome of Salomon.  And beholde a greater then Salomon is here.
042	LUK	011	032	The men of Ninive shall ryse at the iudgement wt this generacio and shall condepne the: for they repented at the preachinge of Ionas.  And beholde a greater then Ionas is here.
042	LUK	011	033	Noo man lighteth a candell and putteth it in a previe place nether vnder a busshell: But on a candelsticke that they that come in maye se ye light.
042	LUK	011	034	The light of thy body is the eye.  Therfore when thine eye is single: then is all thy body full of light.  But if thine eye be evyll: then shall thy body also be full of darknes.
042	LUK	011	035	Take hede therfore that the light which is in the be not darknes.
042	LUK	011	036	For if all thy body shalbe light havynge noo parte darke: then shall all be full of light even as when a candell doeth light the with his brightnes.
042	LUK	011	037	And as he spake a certayne Pharise besought him to dyne with him: and he went in and sate doune to meate.
042	LUK	011	038	When the Pharise sawe that he marveylled yt he had not fyrst wesshed before dyner.
042	LUK	011	039	And ye Lorde sayde to him: Now do ye Pharises make clene the out side of the cup and of the platter: but youre inwarde parties are full of raveninge and wickednes.
042	LUK	011	040	Ye foles dyd not he that made that which is without: make that which is within also?
042	LUK	011	041	Neverthelesse geve almose of that ye have and beholde all is clene to you.
042	LUK	011	042	But wo be to you Pharises for ye tithe the mynt and rewe and all manner erbes and passe over iudgment and the love of God.  These ought ye to have done and yet not to have left the other vndone.
042	LUK	011	043	Wo be to you Pharises: for ye love the vppermost seates in the synagoges and gretinges in the markets.
042	LUK	011	044	Wo be to you scribes and pharises ypocrites for ye are as graves which appere not and the men yt walke over the are not ware of the.
042	LUK	011	045	Then answered one of the lawears and sayd vnto him: Master thus sayinge thou puttest vs to rebuke also.
042	LUK	011	046	Then he sayde: Wo be to you also ye lawears: for ye lade men with burthens greveous to be borne and ye youre selves touche not ye packes wt one of youre fyngers.
042	LUK	011	047	Wo be to you: ye bylde the sepulchres of the Prophetes and youre fathers killed the:
042	LUK	011	048	truly ye beare witnes that ye alowe the dedes of youre fathers for they kylled them and ye bylde their sepulchres.
042	LUK	011	049	Therfore sayde ye wisdome of God: I will send them Prophetes and Apostles and of them they shall slee and persecute:
042	LUK	011	050	that the bloude of all Prophetes which was sheed fro the beginninge of the worlde maye be requyred of this generacion
042	LUK	011	051	from the bloud of Abell vnto the bloud of zachary which perisshed bitwene the aulter and the temple.  Verely I saye vnto you: it shalbe requyred of this nacion.
042	LUK	011	052	Wo be to you lawears: for ye have taken awaye ye keye of knowledge ye entred not in youre selves and them that came in ye forbade.
042	LUK	011	053	When he thus spake vnto them the lawears and the Pharises began to wexe busye about him and to stop his mouth with many questions
042	LUK	011	054	layinge wayte for him and sekinge to catche somethinge of his mought wherby they might accuse him.
042	LUK	012	001	As ther gadered together an innumerable multitude of people (in so moche that they trood one another) he began to saye vnto his disciples: Fyrst of all beware of the leve of the Pharises which is ypocrisy.
042	LUK	012	002	For ther is no thinge covered that shall not be vncovered: nether hyd that shall not be knowen.
042	LUK	012	003	For whatsoever ye have spoken in in darknes: that same shalbe hearde in light.  And that which ye have spoken in the the eare eve in secret places shalbe preached even on the toppe of the housses.
042	LUK	012	004	I saye vnto you my fredes: Be not afrayde of them that kyll the body and after that have no moare that they can do.
042	LUK	012	005	But I will shewe you whom ye shall feare.  Feare him which after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell.  Ye I saye vnto you him feare.
042	LUK	012	006	Are not five sparowes bought for two farthinges?  And yet not one of them is forgotten of God.
042	LUK	012	007	Also even the very heres of youre heedes are nombred.  Feare not therfore: ye are moare of value then many sparowes.
042	LUK	012	008	I saye vnto you: Whosoever confesseth me before men eve him shall ye sonne of man confesse also before ye angels of God.
042	LUK	012	009	And he that denyeth me before men: shalbe denyed before ye angels of God.
042	LUK	012	010	And whosoever speaketh a worde agaynst ye sonne of ma it shalbe forgeven him.  But vnto him yt blasphemeth the holy goost it shall not be forgeven.
042	LUK	012	011	When they bringe you vnto the synagoges and vnto the rulers and officers take no thought how or what thinge ye shall answer or what ye shall speake.
042	LUK	012	012	For the holy goost shall teache you in the same houre what ye ought to saye.
042	LUK	012	013	One of the company sayde vnto hym: Master byd my brother devide the enheritauce with me.
042	LUK	012	014	And he sayde vnto him: Man who made me a iudge or a devider over you?
042	LUK	012	015	Wherfore he sayde vnto them: take hede and beware of covetousnes.  For no mannes lyfe stondeth in the aboundaunce of the thinges which he possesseth.
042	LUK	012	016	And he put forth a similitude vnto them sayinge: The groude of a certayne riche ma brought forth frutes plenteously
042	LUK	012	017	and he thought in himsilfe sayinge: what shall I do?  because I have noo roume where to bestowe my frutes?
042	LUK	012	018	And he sayde: This will I do.  I will destroye my barnes and bilde greater and therin will I gadder all my frutes and my goodes:
042	LUK	012	019	and I will saye to my soule: Soule thou hast moch goodes layde vp in stoore for many yeares take thyne ease: eate drinke and be mery.
042	LUK	012	020	But God sayde vnto him: Thou fole this night will they fetche awaye thy soule agayne from the.  Then whose shall thoose thinges be which thou hast provyded?
042	LUK	012	021	So is it with him that gadereth ryches and is not ryche in God.
042	LUK	012	022	And he spake vnto his disciples: Therfore I saye vnto you: take no thought for youre lyfe what ye shall eate nether for youre body what ye shall put on.
042	LUK	012	023	The lyfe is moare then meate and the bodye is moare then rayment.
042	LUK	012	024	Considre the ravens for they nether sowe nor repe which nether have stoorehousse ner barne and yet God fedeth them.  How moche are ye better then the foules.
042	LUK	012	025	Which of you with takynge thought can adde to his stature one cubit?
042	LUK	012	026	Yf ye then be not able to do that thinge which is least: why take ye thought for the remmaunt?
042	LUK	012	027	Considre the lylies how they growe: They laboure not: they spyn not: and yet I saye vnto you that Salomon in all this royalte was not clothed lyke to one of these.
042	LUK	012	028	Yf the grasse which is todaye in the felde and tomorowe shalbe cast into the fornace God so clothe: how moche moore will he clothe you o ye endued wt litell faith?
042	LUK	012	029	And axe not what ye shall eate or what ye shall drinke nether clyme ye vp an hye
042	LUK	012	030	for all suche thinges the hethen people of the worlde seke for.  Youre father knoweth that ye have nede of suche thinges.
042	LUK	012	031	Wherfore seke ye after the kyngedome of God and all these thinges shalbe ministred vnto you.
042	LUK	012	032	Feare not litell floocke for it is youre fathers pleasure to geve you a kingdome.
042	LUK	012	033	Sell that ye have and geve almes.  And make you bagges which wexe not olde and treasure that fayleth not in heaven where noo these commeth nether moth corrupteth.
042	LUK	012	034	For where youre treasure is there will youre hertes be also.
042	LUK	012	035	Let youre loynes be gerdde about and youre lightes brennynge
042	LUK	012	036	and ye youre selves lyke vnto men that wayte for their master when he will returne fro a weddinge: that assone as he cometh and knocketh they maye ope vnto him.
042	LUK	012	037	Happy are those servauntes which the Lorde when he cometh shall fynde wakynge.  Verely I saye vnto you he will gerdde him selfe about and make them sit doune to meate and walke by and minister vnto them.
042	LUK	012	038	And yf he come in the seconde watche ye if he come in the thyrde watche and shall fynde them soo happy are those servauntes.
042	LUK	012	039	This vnderstonde that yf the good man of the housse knewe what houre ye these wolde come he wolde suerly watche: and not suffer his housse to be broken vp.
042	LUK	012	040	Be ye prepared therfore: for the sonne of man will come at an houre when ye thinke not.
042	LUK	012	041	Then Peter sayde vnto him: Master tellest thou this similitude vnto vs or to all men?
042	LUK	012	042	And the Lorde sayde: If there be any faith full servaut and wise whom his Lorde shall make ruler over his housholde to geve them their duetie of meate at due season:
042	LUK	012	043	happy is that servaunt whom his master when he cometh shall finde soo doinge.
042	LUK	012	044	Of a trueth I saye vnto you: that he will make him ruler over all that he hath.
042	LUK	012	045	But and yf the evyll servaunt shall saye in his hert: My master wyll differre his cominge and shall beginne to smyte the servauntes and maydens and to eate and drinke and to be dronken:
042	LUK	012	046	the Lorde of that servaunt will come in a daye when he thinketh not and at an houre when he is not ware and will devyde him and will geve him his rewarde with the vnbelevers.
042	LUK	012	047	The servaut that knewe his masters will and prepared not him selfe nether dyd accordinge to his will shalbe bete with many strypes.
042	LUK	012	048	But he that knewe not and yet dyd committe thinges worthy of strypes shalbe beaten with feawe strypes.  For vnto whom moche is geven of him shalbe moche requyred.  And to whom men moche commyt the moare of him will they axe.
042	LUK	012	049	I am come to sende fyre on erth: and what is my dysyre but that it were all redy kyndled?
042	LUK	012	050	Not with stondinge I must de baptised with a baptyme: and how am I payned till it be ended?
042	LUK	012	051	Suppose ye that I am come to sende peace on erth?  I tell you naye: but rather debate.
042	LUK	012	052	For fro hence forthe ther shalbe five in one housse devided thre agaynst two and two agaynst thre.
042	LUK	012	053	The father shalbe devided agaynst the sonne and the sonne agaynst the father.  The mother agaynst the doughter and the doughter agaynst the mother.  The motereleawe agaynst hir doughterelawe and the doughterelawe agaynst hir motherelawe.
042	LUK	012	054	Then sayde he to the people: when ye se a cloude ryse out of the west strayght waye ye saye: we shall have a shower and soo it is.
042	LUK	012	055	And when ye se the south wynde blow ye saye: we shall have heet and it cometh to passe.
042	LUK	012	056	Ypocrites ye can skyll of the fassion of the erth and of the skye: but what is ye cause that ye canot skyll of this time?
042	LUK	012	057	Ye and why iudge ye not of youre selves what is righte?
042	LUK	012	058	Whill thou goest with thyne adversary to the ruler: as thou arte in the waye geve diligence that thou mayst be delivered fro him least he bringe the to the iudge and the iudge delyver the to the iaylar and the iaylar cast the in to preson.
042	LUK	012	059	I tell ye thou departest not thence tyll thou have made good ye vtmost myte.
042	LUK	013	001	Ther were present at the same season that shewed him of ye Galileas whose bloude Pylate mengled with their awne sacrifice.
042	LUK	013	002	And Iesus answered and sayde vnto them: Suppose ye that these Galileans were greater synners then all the other Galileas because they suffred suche punisshmet?
042	LUK	013	003	I tell you naye: but except ye repent ye shall all in lyke wyse perysshe.
042	LUK	013	004	Or those. xviii.  apon which ye toure in Syloe fell and slewe the thinke ye that they were synners above all men yt dwell in Ierusalem?
042	LUK	013	005	I tell you naye: But excepte ye repent ye all shall lykewyse perisshe.
042	LUK	013	006	He put forthe this similiiude A certayne man had a fygge tree planted in his veneyarde and he came and sought frute theron and founde none.
042	LUK	013	007	Then sayde he to ye dresser of his vyneyarde: Beholde this thre yeare have I come and sought frute in this fygge tree and fynde none: cut it doune: why combreth it the grounde?
042	LUK	013	008	And he answered and sayde vnto him: lorde let it alone this yeare also till I digge rounde aboute it and doge it to se
042	LUK	013	009	whether it will beare frute: and if it beare not then after yt cut it doune
042	LUK	013	010	And he taught in one of their sinagoges on ye saboth dayes.
042	LUK	013	011	And beholde ther was a woma which had a sprete of infirmite. xviii.  yeares: and was bowed to gether and coulde not lifte vp hersilfe at all.
042	LUK	013	012	When Iesus sawe her he called her to him and sayde to her: woman thou arte delyvered from thy disease.
042	LUK	013	013	And he layde his hondes on her and immediatly she was made strayght and glorified God.
042	LUK	013	014	And the ruler of the sinagoge answered with indignacion (be cause that Iesus had healed on the saboth daye) and sayde vnto the people.  Ther are sixe dayes in which men ought to worke: in them come and be healed and not on the saboth daye.
042	LUK	013	015	Then answered him the Lorde and sayd: Ypocrite doth not eache one of you on the saboth daye lowse his oxe or his asse from the stall and leade him to the water?
042	LUK	013	016	And ought not this doughter of Abraham whom Sathan hath bounde loo. xviii.  yeares be lowsed from this bonde on the saboth daye?
042	LUK	013	017	And when he thus sayde all his adversaries were ashamed and all the people reioysed on all the excellent dedes that were done by him.
042	LUK	013	018	Then sayde he: What is the kyngdome of God lyke?  or wherto shall I compare it?
042	LUK	013	019	It is lyke a grayne of mustard seede which a man toke and sowed in his garden: and it grewe and wexed a greate tree and the foules of the ayer made nestes in the braunches of it.
042	LUK	013	020	And agayne he sayde: wher vnto shall I lyken ye kyngdome of god?
042	LUK	013	021	it is lyke leve which a woman toke and hidde in thre busshels of floure tyll all was thorow levended.
042	LUK	013	022	And he went thorow all maner of cities and tounes teachinge and iorneyinge towardes Ierusalem.
042	LUK	013	023	Then sayde one vnto him: Lorde are ther feawe that shalbe saved?  And he sayde vnto them:
042	LUK	013	024	stryve with youre selves to enter in at ye strayte gate: For many I saye vnto you will seke to enter in and shall not be able.
042	LUK	013	025	When the good man of ye housse is rysen vp and hath shett to the dore ye shall beginne to stonde with out and to knocke at the dore sayinge: Lorde lorde open vnto vs: and he shall answer and saye vnto you: I knowe you not whence ye are.
042	LUK	013	026	Then shall ye begin to saye.  We have eaten in thy presence and dronke and thou hast taught in oure stretes.
042	LUK	013	027	And he shall saye: I tell you I knowe you not whence ye are: departe from me all ye workers of iniquite.
042	LUK	013	028	There shalbe wepinge and gnasshinge of teth when ye shall se Abraham and Isaac and Iacob and all the prophetes in the kyngdom of God and youre selves thrust oute at dores.
042	LUK	013	029	And they shall come from the eest and from the weest and from the northe and from the southe and shall syt doune in the kyngdome of God.
042	LUK	013	030	And beholde ther are last which shalbe fyrst: And ther are fyrst which shalbe last.
042	LUK	013	031	The same daye there came certayne of the pharises and sayd vnto him: Get the out of the waye and departe hence: for Herode will kyll ye.
042	LUK	013	032	And he sayd vnto them.  Goo ye and tell that foxe beholde I cast oute devyls and heale the people to daye and to morowe and the third daye I make an ende.
042	LUK	013	033	Neverthelesse I must walke todaye and tomorowe and the daye folowinge: For it cannot be that a Prophet perishe eny other where save at Ierusalem.
042	LUK	013	034	O Ierusalem Ierusalem which kyllest prophetes and stonest them that are sent to ye: how often wolde I have gadered thy childre to gedder as the hen gathereth her nest vnder her wynges but ye wolde not.
042	LUK	013	035	Beholde youre habitacion shalbe left vnto you desolate.  For I tell you ye shall not se me vntill the tyme come that ye shall saye blessed is he that commeth in the name of the Lorde.
042	LUK	014	001	And it chaunsed that he went into the housse of one of ye chefe pharises to eate breed on a saboth daye: and they watched him.
042	LUK	014	002	And beholde ther was a man before him which had the dropsye.
042	LUK	014	003	And Iesus answered and spake vnto the lawears and pharises sayinge: is it laufull to heale on the saboth daye?
042	LUK	014	004	And they helde their peace.  And he toke him and healed him and let him goo:
042	LUK	014	005	and answered the sayinge whiche of you shall have an asse or an oxe fallen into a pitt and will not strayght waye pull him out on the Saboth daye?
042	LUK	014	006	And they coulde not answer him agayne to that.
042	LUK	014	007	He put forthe a similitude to ye gestes whe he marked how they preased to the hyest roumes and sayd vnto the:
042	LUK	014	008	When thou arte bidde to a weddynge of eny man syt not doune in ye hyest roume lest a more honorable man then thou be bidden of him
042	LUK	014	009	and he that bade bothe him and the come and saye to the: geve this man roume and thou then beginne with shame to take the lowest roume.
042	LUK	014	010	But rather when thou arte bidden goo and syt in the lowest roume that when he that bade the cometh he maye saye vnto the: frende syt vp hyer.  Then shalt thou have worshippe in the presence of them that syt at meate with the.
042	LUK	014	011	For whosoever exalteth him sylfe shalbe brought lowe.  And he yt hubleth him sylfe shalbe exalted
042	LUK	014	012	Then sayde he also to him that had desyred him to diner: When thou makest a diner or a supper: call not thy frendes nor thy brethre nether thy kinsmen nor yet ryche neghbours: lest they bidde the agayne and a recompence be made the.
042	LUK	014	013	But when thou makest afeast call the poore the maymed the lame and the blynde
042	LUK	014	014	and thou shalt be happy for they cannot recompence the.  But thou shalt be recompensed at the resurreccion of the iuste men.
042	LUK	014	015	When one of them that sate at meate also hearde that he sayde vnto him: happy is he that eateth breed in the kyngdome of God.
042	LUK	014	016	Then sayd he to him.  A certayne man ordened a greate supper and bade many
042	LUK	014	017	and sent his servaunt at supper tyme to saye to them that wer bidden come: for all thinges are now redy.
042	LUK	014	018	And they all atonce begane to make excuse.  The fyrst sayd vnto him: I have bought a ferme and I must nedes goo and se it I praye the have me excused.
042	LUK	014	019	And another sayd: I hove bought fyve yooke of oxen and I goo to prove them I praye the have me excused.
042	LUK	014	020	The thyrde sayd: I have maried a wyfe and therfore I cannot come.
042	LUK	014	021	And the servaunt went and brought his master worde therof.  Then was the good man of the housse displeased and sayd to his servaut: Goo out quickly into ye stretes and quarters of the cite and bringe in hidder the poore and the maymed and the halt and the blynde.
042	LUK	014	022	And the servaut sayd: lorde it is done as thou comaundedst and yet ther is roume.
042	LUK	014	023	And the lorde sayd to the servaunt: Go out into ye hye wayes and hedges and compell the to come in that my housse maye be filled.
042	LUK	014	024	For I saye vnto you that none of those men which were bidde shall tast of my supper.
042	LUK	014	025	Ther went agreate copany with him and he turned and sayde vnto them:
042	LUK	014	026	If a man come to me and hate not his father and mother and wyfe and chyldren and brethren and sisters more over and his awne lyfe he cannot be my disciple.
042	LUK	014	027	And whosoever beare not his crosse and come after me cannot be my disciple.
042	LUK	014	028	Which of you disposed to bilde a toure sytteth not doune before and counteth ye cost whether he have sufficient to performe it?
042	LUK	014	029	lest after he hath layde ye foundacion and is not able to performe it all yt beholde it beginne to mocke him
042	LUK	014	030	sayinge: this man beganne to bilde and was not able to make an ende.
042	LUK	014	031	Or what kynge goeth to make batayle agaynst another kinge and sitteth not doune fyrst and casteth in his mynde whether he be able wt ten thousande to mete him that cometh agaynst him wt. xx thousand.
042	LUK	014	032	Or els whyll ye other is yet a greate waye of he will sende embasseatours and desyre peace.
042	LUK	014	033	So lykewyse none of you yt forsaketh not all yt he hath can be my disciple.
042	LUK	014	034	Salt is good but yf salt have loste hyr saltnes what shall be seasoned ther with?
042	LUK	014	035	It is nether good for ye londe nor yet for ye donge hill but men cast it out at ye dores.  He yt hath eares to heare let him heare.
042	LUK	015	001	Then resorted vnto him all ye publicas and synners for to heare him.
042	LUK	015	002	And the pharises and scribes murmured sayinge: He receaved to his copany synners and eateth with them.
042	LUK	015	003	Then put he forthe this similitude to the sayinge:
042	LUK	015	004	What man of you havynge an hundred shepe yf he loose one of thee doth not leve nynty and nyne in the wyldernes and goo after yt which is loost vntyll he fynde him?
042	LUK	015	005	And whe he hath founde him he putteth him on his shulders with ioye:
042	LUK	015	006	And assone as he cometh home he calleth to gedder his lovers and neghbours sayinge vnto them: reioyse with me for I have founde my shepe which was loost.
042	LUK	015	007	I say vnto you yt lyke wyse ioye shalbe in heven over one synner yt repenteth moore then over nynety and nyne iuste persons whiche nede noo repentauce.
042	LUK	015	008	Ether what woman havynge. x.  grotes yf she loose one doth not lyght a candell and swepe ye housse and seke diligently tyll she fynde it?
042	LUK	015	009	And when she hath founde it she calleth her lovers and her neghbours sayinge: Reioyce wt me for I have founde the groate which I had loost.
042	LUK	015	010	Lykwyse I saye vnto you ioye is made in ye presence of ye angels of god over one synner yt repenteth.
042	LUK	015	011	And he sayde: a certayne man had two sonnes
042	LUK	015	012	and the yonger of them sayde to his father: father geve me my parte of the goodes yt to me belongeth.  And he devided vnto them his substaunce.
042	LUK	015	013	And not longe after ye yonger sonne gaddered all that he had to gedder and toke his iorney into a farre countre and theare he wasted his goodes with royetous lyvinge.
042	LUK	015	014	And when he had spent all that he had ther rose a greate derth thorow out all yt same londe and he began to lacke.
042	LUK	015	015	And he went and clave to a citesyn of yt same countre which sent him to his felde to kepe his swyne.
042	LUK	015	016	And he wold fayne have filled his bely with the coddes that ye swyne ate: and noo man gave him.
042	LUK	015	017	Then he came to him selfe and sayde: how many hyred servauntes at my fathers have breed ynough and I dye for honger.
042	LUK	015	018	I will aryse and goo to my father and will saye vnto him: father I have synned agaynst heven and before ye
042	LUK	015	019	and am no moare worthy to be called thy sonne make me as one of thy hyred servauntes.
042	LUK	015	020	And he arose and went to his father.  And when he was yet a greate waye of his father sawe him and had compassion and ran and fell on his necke and kyssed him.
042	LUK	015	021	And the sonne sayd vnto him: father I have synned agaynst heven and in thy sight and am no moare worthy to be called thy sonne.
042	LUK	015	022	But his father sayde to his servautes: bringe forth that best garment and put it on him and put a rynge on his honde and showes on his fete.
042	LUK	015	023	And bringe hidder that fatted caulfe and kyll him and let vs eate and be mery:
042	LUK	015	024	for this my sonne was deed and is alyve agayne he was loste and is now founde.  And they began to be merye.
042	LUK	015	025	The elder brother was in the felde and when he cam and drewe nye to ye housse he herde minstrelcy and daunsynge
042	LUK	015	026	and called one of his servauntes and axed what thoose thinges meate.
042	LUK	015	027	And he sayd vnto him: thy brother is come and thy father had kylled ye fatted caulfe because he hath receaved him safe and sounde.
042	LUK	015	028	And he was angry and wolde not goo in.  Then came his father out and entreated him.
042	LUK	015	029	He answered and sayde to his father: Loo these many yeares have I done the service nether brake at eny tyme thy commaundment and yet gavest thou me never soo moche as a kyd to make mery wt my lovers:
042	LUK	015	030	but assone as this thy sonne was come which hath devoured thy goodes with harlootes thou haste for his pleasure kylled ye fatted caulfe.
042	LUK	015	031	And he sayd vnto him: Sonne thou wast ever with me and all that I have is thyne:
042	LUK	015	032	it was mete that we shuld make mery and be glad: for this thy brother was deed and is a lyve agayne: and was loste and is founde.
042	LUK	016	001	And he sayd also vnto his disciples.  Ther was a certayne rych man which had a stewarde that was acused vnto him that he had wasted his goodes.
042	LUK	016	002	And he called him and sayd vnto him: How is it that I heare this of the?  Geve a comptes of thy steward shippe: For thou mayste be no longer stewarde.
042	LUK	016	003	The stewarde sayd wt in him selfe: what shall I do?  for my master will take awaye fro me ye stewarde shippe.  I canot digge and to begge I am ashamed.
042	LUK	016	004	I woote what to do yt when I am put out of ye stewardshippe they maye receave me into their houses.
042	LUK	016	005	Then called he all his masters detters and sayd vnto ye fyrst: how moche owest thou vnto my master?
042	LUK	016	006	And he sayd: an hondred tonnes of oyle.  And he sayd to him: take thy bill and syt doune quickly and wryte fiftie.
042	LUK	016	007	Then sayd he to another: what owest thou?  And he sayde: an hondred quarters of wheate.  He sayd to him: Take thy bill and write foure scoore.
042	LUK	016	008	And the lorde comended the vniust stewarde because he had done wysly.  For ye chyldren of this worlde are in their kynde wyser then ye chyldren of lyght.
042	LUK	016	009	And I saye also vnto you: make you frendes of the wicked mammon that when ye shall departe they may receave you into everlastinge habitacions.
042	LUK	016	010	He that is faithfull in that which is leste ye same is faithfull in moche.  And he yt is vnfaithfull in ye least: is vnfaithfull also in moche.
042	LUK	016	011	So then yf ye have not ben faithfull in ye wicked mamon?  who will beleve you in that which is true?
042	LUK	016	012	And yf ye have not bene faithfull in another manes busines: who shall geve you youre awne?
042	LUK	016	013	No servaunt can serve. ii.  masters for other he shall hate ye one and love ye other or els he shall lene to the one and despyse the other.  Ye can not serve God and mammon.
042	LUK	016	014	All these thinges herde the pharises also which were coveteous and they mocked him.
042	LUK	016	015	And he sayd vnto the: Ye are they which iustifie youre selves before me: but God knoweth youre hertes.  For ye which is highlie estemed amoge me is abhominable in yt sight of god
042	LUK	016	016	The lawe and the Prophetes raygned vntyll the tyme of Iohn: and sence that tyme the kyngdom of God is preached and every man stryveth to goo in.
042	LUK	016	017	Soner shall heven and erth perisshe then one tytle of the lawe shall perisshe.
042	LUK	016	018	Whosoever forsaketh his wyfe and marieth another breaketh matrimony.  And every man which marieth her that is devorsed from her husbande committeth advoutry also.
042	LUK	016	019	Ther was a certayne ryche man which was clothed in purple and fyne bysse and fared deliciously every daye.
042	LUK	016	020	And ther was a certayne begger named Lazarus whiche laye at his gate full of soores
042	LUK	016	021	desyringe to be refresshed with the cromes whiche fell from the ryche manes borde.  Neverthelesse the dogges came and licked his soores.
042	LUK	016	022	And yt fortuned that the begger dyed and was caried by the angelles into Abrahas bosome.  The riche man also died and was buried.
042	LUK	016	023	And beinge in hell in tormetes he lyfte vp his eyes and sawe Abraham a farre of and Lazarus in his bosome
042	LUK	016	024	and he cryed and sayd: father Abraham have mercy on me and sende Lazarus that he maye dippe the tippe of his fynger in water and cole my tonge: for I am tourmented in this flame.
042	LUK	016	025	But Abraha sayd vnto him Sonne remembre that thou in thy lyfe tyme receavedst thy pleasure and contrary wyse Lazarus payne.  Now therfore is he comforted and thou art punysshed.
042	LUK	016	026	Beyonde all this bitwene you and vs ther is a greate space set so that they which wolde goo from thence to you cannot: nether maye come from thence to vs.
042	LUK	016	027	Then he sayd: I praye the therfore father send him to my fathers housse.
042	LUK	016	028	For I have fyve brethren: for to warne the left they also come into this place of tourmet.
042	LUK	016	029	Abraha sayd vnto him: they have Moses and the Prophetes let them heare them.
042	LUK	016	030	And he sayd: naye father Abraham but yf one came vnto the from the ded they wolde repent.
042	LUK	016	031	He sayd vnto him: If they heare not Moses and ye prophetes nether will they beleve though one roose from deeth agayne.
042	LUK	017	001	Then sayde he to ye disciples it can not be avoyded but that offences will come.  Neverthelesse wo be to him thorow whom they come.
042	LUK	017	002	It were better for him that a mylstone were hanged aboute his necke and that he were cast into ye see then that he shuld offende one of this lytleons.
042	LUK	017	003	Take hede to youre selves.  If thy brother trespas agaynst the rebuke him:
042	LUK	017	004	and yf he repent forgeve him.  And though he sinne agest ye. vii.  tymes in a daye and seve tymes in a daye tourne agayne to ye sayinge: it repenteth me forgeve him
042	LUK	017	005	And the apostles sayde vnto the Lorde: increase oure faith.
042	LUK	017	006	And the Lorde sayde: yf ye had faith lyke a grayne of mustard sede and shuld saye vnto this sycamine tree plucke thy selfe vp by the rootes and plant thy selfe in the see: he should obey you.
042	LUK	017	007	Who is it of you yf he had a servaute plowinge or fedinge catell that wolde saye vnto him when he were come from the felde Goo quickly and syt doune to meate:
042	LUK	017	008	and wolde not rather saye to him dresse wherwith I maye sup and gyrde vp thy selfe and serve me tyll I have eaten and dronken: and afterwarde eate thou and drinke thou?
042	LUK	017	009	Doeth he thanke that servaunt because he dyd that which was commaunded vnto him?  I trowe not.
042	LUK	017	010	Soo lyke wyse ye when ye have done all thoose thinges which are commaunded you: saye we are vnprofitable servautes.  We have done: ye which was oure duetye to do.
042	LUK	017	011	And it chaunsed as he went to Ierusalem that he passed thorow Samaria and Galile.
042	LUK	017	012	And as he entred into a certayne toune ther met him ten men yt were lepers.  Which stode a farre of
042	LUK	017	013	and put forth their voyces and sayde: Iesu master have mercy on vs.
042	LUK	017	014	When he sawe the he sayde vnto them: Goo and shewe youre selves to the prestes.  And it chaunsed as they went they were clensed.
042	LUK	017	015	And one of them when he sawe that he was clensed turned backe agayne and with a loude voyce praysed God
042	LUK	017	016	and fell doune on his face at his fete and gave him thankes.  And the same was a Samaritane.
042	LUK	017	017	And Iesus answered and sayde: are ther not ten clensed?  But where are those nyne?
042	LUK	017	018	Ther are not founde that returned agane to geve God prayse save only this straunger.
042	LUK	017	019	And he sayde vnto him: aryse and goo thy waye thy faith hath made the whoale.
042	LUK	017	020	When he was demaunded of ye pharises when the kyngdome of God shuld come: he answered them and sayde: The kyngdome of God cometh not with waytinge for.
042	LUK	017	021	Nether shall men saye: Loo here loo there.  For beholde the kyngdome of God is with in you.
042	LUK	017	022	And he sayde vnto the disciples: The dayes will come when ye shall desyre to se one daye of the sonne of man and ye shall not se it.
042	LUK	017	023	And they shall saye to you: Se here Se there.  Goo not after them nor folowe them
042	LUK	017	024	for as the lyghtenynge that apereth out of the one parte of the heven and shyneth vnto the other parte of heven: Soo shall the sonne of man be in his dayes.
042	LUK	017	025	But fyrst must he suffre many thinges and be refused of this nacion.
042	LUK	017	026	As it happened in ye tyme of Noe: So shall it be in the tyme of the sonne of man.
042	LUK	017	027	They ate they dranke they maryed wyves and were maryed even vnto yt same daye yt Noe went into ye arke: and ye floud cam and destroyed the all.
042	LUK	017	028	Lykewyse also as it chaunsed in the dayes of Lot.  They ate they dranke they bought they solde they planted they bilte.
042	LUK	017	029	And even the same daye that Lot went out of Zodom it rayned fyre and brymstone from heven and destroyed them all.
042	LUK	017	030	After these ensamples shall it be in the daye when the sonne of man shall appere.
042	LUK	017	031	At that daye he that is on the housse toppe and his stuffe in the housse: let him not come doune to take it out.  And lykewyse let not him that is in the feldes turne backe agayne to that he lefte behynde.
042	LUK	017	032	Remember Lottes wyfe.
042	LUK	017	033	Whosoever will goo about to save his lyfe shall loose it: And whosoever shall loose his lyfe shall save it.
042	LUK	017	034	I tell you: In that nyght ther shalbe two in one beed the one shalbe receaved and the other shalbe forsaken.
042	LUK	017	035	Two shalbe also a grindynge to gedder: the one shalbe receaved and the other forsaken.
042	LUK	017	037	And they answered and sayde to him: wheare Lorde?  And he sayd vnto the: whersoever ye body shalbe thyther will the egles resoorte.
042	LUK	018	001	And he put forth a similitude vnto the signifyinge that men ought alwayes to praye and not to be wery
042	LUK	018	002	sayinge: Ther was a Iudge in a certayne cite which feared not god nether regarded man.
042	LUK	018	003	And ther was a certayne wedowe in the same cite which came vnto him sayinge: avenge me of myne adversary.
042	LUK	018	004	And he wolde not for a whyle.  But afterwarde he sayd vnto him selfe: though I feare not God nor care for man
042	LUK	018	005	yet because this wedowe troubleth me I will avenge her lest at the laste she come and hagge on me.
042	LUK	018	006	And the lorde sayd: heare what the vnrightewes Iudge sayeth.
042	LUK	018	007	And shall not god avenge his electe which crye daye and nyght vnto him ye though he differre them?
042	LUK	018	008	I tell you he will avenge them and that quickly.  Neverthelesse when the sonne of man cometh suppose ye that he shall fynde faithe on the erthe.
042	LUK	018	009	And he put forthe this similitude vnto certayne which trusted in the selves yt they were perfecte and despysed other.
042	LUK	018	010	Two men went vp into ye teple to praye: ye one a pharise and the other a publican.
042	LUK	018	011	The pharise stode and prayed thus wt him selfe.  God I thanke the yt I am not as other men are extorsioners vniuste advoutrers or as this publican.
042	LUK	018	012	I fast twyse in ye weke.  I geve tythe of all that I possesse.
042	LUK	018	013	And the publican stode afarre of and wolde not lyfte vp his eyes to heven but smote his brest sayinge: God be mercyfull to me a synner.
042	LUK	018	014	I tell you: this ma departed hoe to his housse iustified moore then the other.  For every man that exalteth him selfe shalbe brought low: And he yt hubleth him selfe shalbe exalted
042	LUK	018	015	They brought vnto him also babes yt he shuld touche the.  When his disciples sawe that they rebuked the.
042	LUK	018	016	But Iesus called the vnto him and sayde: Suffre chyldren to come vnto me and forbidde the not.  For of soche is ye kyngdome of God.
042	LUK	018	017	Verely I saye vnto you: whosoever receaveth not the kyngdome of God as a chylde: he shall not enter therin.
042	LUK	018	018	And a certayne ruler axed him sayinge: Good Master: what ought I to do to obtayne eternall lyfe?
042	LUK	018	019	Iesus sayd vnto him: Why callest thou me good?  No man is good save God only.
042	LUK	018	020	Thou knowest ye comaundmentes: Thou shalt not commit advoutry: thou shalt not kyll: thou shalt not steale: thou shalt not beare false witnes: Honoure thy father and thy mother.
042	LUK	018	021	And he sayde: all these have I kept from my youthe.
042	LUK	018	022	When Iesus hearde that he sayde vnto him: Yet lackest thou one thinge.  Sell all that thou hast and distribute it vnto the poore and thou shalt have treasure in heven and come and folowe me.
042	LUK	018	023	When he heard that he was hevy: for he was very ryche.
042	LUK	018	024	When Iesus sawe him morne he sayde: with what difficulte shall they that have ryches enter into the kyngdome of God:
042	LUK	018	025	it is easyer for a camell to goo thorow a nedles eye then for a ryche man to enter into the kyngdome of God.
042	LUK	018	026	Then sayde they that hearde that: And who shall then be saved?
042	LUK	018	027	And he sayde: Thinges which are vnpossible with men are possible with God.
042	LUK	018	028	Then Peter sayde: Loo we have lefte all and have folowed the.
042	LUK	018	029	And he sayde vnto them: Verely I saye vnto you ther is noo man that leaveth housse other father and mother other brethren or wyfe or chyldren for the kyngdome of Goddes sake
042	LUK	018	030	which same shall not receave moche moore in this worlde: and in the worlde to come lyfe everlastinge.
042	LUK	018	031	He toke vnto him twelve and sayde vnto them.  Beholde we go vp to Ierusalem and all shalbe fulfilled that are written by ye Prophetes of the sonne of man.
042	LUK	018	032	He shalbe delivered vnto the gentils and shalbe mocked and shalbe despytfully entreated and shalbe spetted on:
042	LUK	018	033	and when they have scourged him they will put him to deeth and the thyrde daye he shall aryse agayne.
042	LUK	018	034	But they vnderstode none of these thinges.  And this sayinge was hid fro them.  And they perceaved not the thinges which were spoken.
042	LUK	018	035	And it came to passe as he was come nye vnto Hierico a certayne blynde man sate by the waye syde begginge.
042	LUK	018	036	And when he hearde the people passe by he axed what it meant.
042	LUK	018	037	And they sayde vnto him yt Iesus of Nazareth passed by.
042	LUK	018	038	And he cryed sayinge: Iesus ye sonne of David have thou mercy on me.
042	LUK	018	039	And they which went before rebuked him that he shuld holde his peace.  But he cryed so moche the moare thou sonne of David have mercy on me.
042	LUK	018	040	And Iesus stode styll and commaunded him to be brought vnto him.  And when he was come neare he axed him
042	LUK	018	041	sayinge: What wilt thou that I do vnto the?  And he sayde: Lorde yt I maye receave my sight.
042	LUK	018	042	Iesus sayde vnto him: receave thy sight: thy faith hath saved the.
042	LUK	018	043	And immediatly he sawe and folowed him praysinge God.  And all the people when they sawe it gave laude to God.
042	LUK	019	001	And he entred in and went thorow Hierico.
042	LUK	019	002	And beholde ther was a ma named Zacheus which was a ruler amoge the Publicans and was riche also.
042	LUK	019	003	And he made meanes to se Iesus what he shuld be: and coulde not for the preace because he was of a lowe stature.
042	LUK	019	004	Wherfore he ran before and asceded vp into a wilde fygge tree to se him: for he shulde come that same waye.
042	LUK	019	005	And when Iesus cam to the place he loked vp and sawe him and sayd vnto him: zache attonce come doune for to daye I must abyde at thy housse.
042	LUK	019	006	And he came doune hastelye and receaved him ioyfully.
042	LUK	019	007	And when they sawe that they all groudged sayinge: He is gone in to tary with a man that is a synner.
042	LUK	019	008	And zache stode forth and sayd vnto ye Lorde: beholde Lorde ye haulfe of my gooddes I geve to the povre and if I have done eny ma wroge I will restore him fower folde.
042	LUK	019	009	And Iesus sayd to him: this daye is healthe come vnto this housse for as moche as it also is become the chylde of Abraha.
042	LUK	019	010	For the sonne of ma is come to seke and to save that which was looste.
042	LUK	019	011	As they hearde these thinges he added ther to a similitude be cause he was nye to Hierusalem and because also they thought that the kyngdome of God shuld shortely appere.
042	LUK	019	012	He sayde therfore: a certayne noble man wet into a farre countre to receave him a kyngdome and then to come agayne.
042	LUK	019	013	And he called his ten servauntes and delyvered them ten pounde sayinge vnto them: by and sell till I come.
042	LUK	019	014	But his citesens hated him and sent messengers after him sayinge: We will not have this man to raygne over vs.
042	LUK	019	015	And it came to passe when he was come agayne and had receaved his kyngdome he comaunded these servautes to be called to him (to whom he gave his money) to witt what every man had done.
042	LUK	019	016	Then came ye fyrst sayinge: Lorde thy pounde hath encreased ten poude.
042	LUK	019	017	And he sayde vnto him: Well good servaute because thou wast faithfull in a very lytell thynge take thou auctorite over ten cities.
042	LUK	019	018	And the other came sayinge: Lorde thy poude hath encreased fyve pounde.
042	LUK	019	019	And to ye same he sayde: and be thou also ruler ouer fyve cities.
042	LUK	019	020	And the thyrde came and sayde: Lorde beholde here thy pounde which I have kepte in a napkyn
042	LUK	019	021	for I feared the because thou arte a strayte man: thou takest vp that thou laydest not doune and repest that thou dyddest not sowe.
042	LUK	019	022	And he sayde vnto him: Of thine awne mouth iudge I the thou evyll servaunt.  knewest thou that I am a strayte man takinge vp that I layde not doune and repinge that I dyd not sowe?
042	LUK	019	023	Wherfore then gavest not thou my money into the banke that at my cominge I might have required myne awne with vauntage?
042	LUK	019	024	And he sayde to them that stode by: take fro him that pounde and geve it him that hath ten poude.
042	LUK	019	025	And they sayd vnto him: Lorde he hath ten pounde.
042	LUK	019	026	I saye vnto you that vnto all the that have it shalbe geve: and from him yt hath not eve that he hath shalbe taken from him.
042	LUK	019	027	Moreover those myne enemys which wolde not that I shuld raigne over them bringe hidder and slee them before me.
042	LUK	019	028	And when he had thus spoken he proceded forthe before a ssendinge vp to Ierusalem.
042	LUK	019	029	And it fortuned when he was come nye to Bethphage and Bethany besydes moute olivete he sent two of his disciples
042	LUK	019	030	sayinge: Goo ye in to the toune which is over agaynste you.  In the which assone as ye are come ye shall finde a colte tyed wheron yet never man sate.  Lowse him and bringe him hider.
042	LUK	019	031	And if eny man axe you why that ye loowse him: thus saye vnto him ye lorde hath nede of him.
042	LUK	019	032	They that were sent went their waye and founde eve as he had sayde vnto the.
042	LUK	019	033	And as they were aloosinge ye coolte the owners sayde vnto the: why lowse ye ye coolte?
042	LUK	019	034	And they sayde: for ye Lorde hath nede of him.
042	LUK	019	035	And they brought him to Iesus.  And they cast their raymet on ye colte and set Iesus thero.
042	LUK	019	036	And as he wet they spredde their clothes in ye waye.
042	LUK	019	037	And when he was now come wheare he shuld goo doune fro the moute olivete ye whole multitude of ye disciples began to reioyce and to lawde God with a loude voyce for all ye miracles yt they had sene
042	LUK	019	038	sayinge: Blessed be the kynge that cometh in the name of the Lorde: peace in heave and glory in the hyest.
042	LUK	019	039	And some of ye Pharises of the copany sayde vnto him: Master rebuke thy disciples.
042	LUK	019	040	He answered and sayde vnto the: I tell you yf these shuld holde their peace the stones wold crye.
042	LUK	019	041	And when he was come neare he behelde the citie and wept on it
042	LUK	019	042	sayinge: Yf thou haddest dest knowen those thinges which belonge vn thy peace eve at this thy tyme.  But now are they hydde from thyne eyes.
042	LUK	019	043	For the dayes shall come vpo the that thy enemys shall cast a banke aboute the and copasse the rounde and kepe the in on every syde
042	LUK	019	044	and make the even with the grounde with thy chyldren which are in the.  And they shall not leve in the one stone vpo another because thou knewest not the tyme of thy visitacion.
042	LUK	019	045	And he went in to the temple and begane to cast out them that solde therin and them that bought
042	LUK	019	046	sayinge vnto them yt is written: my housse is the housse of prayer: but ye have made it a den of theves.
042	LUK	019	047	And he taught dayly in the temple.  The hye Prestes and the Scribes and the chefe of the people went about to destroye him:
042	LUK	019	048	but coulde not finde what to do.  For all the people stacke by him and gave him audience.
042	LUK	020	001	And yt fortuned in one of those dayes as he taught the people in the temple and preached the gospell: the hye prestes and the scribes came with the elders
042	LUK	020	002	and spake vnto him sayinge.  Tell vs by what auctorite thou doest these thinges?  Ether who is he yt gave ye this auctorite?
042	LUK	020	003	He answered and saide vnto the: I also will axe you a questio and answer me.
042	LUK	020	004	The baptyme of Iohn: was it from heaven or of men?
042	LUK	020	005	And they thought with in them selves sayinge: yf we shall saye from heave: he will saye: why then beleved ye him not?
042	LUK	020	006	But and yf we shall saye of men all ye people will stone vs.  For they be persuaded that Ihon is a Prophet.
042	LUK	020	007	And they answered that they coulde not tell whence it was.
042	LUK	020	008	And Iesus sayde vnto them: nether tell I you by what auctorite I do these thinges.
042	LUK	020	009	Then begane he to put forthe to the people this similitude.  A certayne man planted a vyneyarde and let it forthe to fermers and went him selfe into a straunge countre for a greate season.
042	LUK	020	010	And when the tyme was come he sent a servaut to his tennauntes that they shuld geve him of the frutes of the vyneyarde.  And the tennauntes dyd bet him and sent him awaye empty.
042	LUK	020	011	And agayne he sent yet another servaunt.  And they dyd bet him and foule entreated him also and sent him awaye emptye.
042	LUK	020	012	Moreover he sent the thyrde to and him they wouded and cast out.
042	LUK	020	013	Then sayde the lorde of the vyneyarde: what shall I do?  I will sende my deare sonne him peradventure they will reverence when they se him.
042	LUK	020	014	But when the fermers sawe him they thought in them selves sayinge: this is the heyre come let vs kyll him that the inheritaunce maye be oures.
042	LUK	020	015	And they cast him out of the vyneyarde and kylled him.  Now what shall the Lorde of the vyneyarde do vnto them?
042	LUK	020	016	He will come and destroye those fermers and will let out his vyneyarde to other.  When they hearde that they sayde: God forbyd.
042	LUK	020	017	And he behelde them and sayde: what meaneth this then yt is wrytten: The stone that the bylders refused the same is made ye heed corner stone?
042	LUK	020	018	whosoever stomble at that stone shalbe broken: but on whosoever it faul vpon it wyll grynde him to powder.
042	LUK	020	019	And the hye Prestes and the Scribes the same howre went about to laye hondes on him but they feared the people.  For they perceaved that he had spoken this similitude agaynst them.
042	LUK	020	020	And they watched him and sent forth spies which shuld fayne them selves perfecte to take him in his wordes and to delyvre him vnto the power and auctorite of the debite.
042	LUK	020	021	And they axed him sayinge: Master we knowe that thou sayest and teachest ryght nother cosiderest thou eny manes degre but teachest the waye of God truly.
042	LUK	020	022	Ys it laufull for vs to geve Cesar tribute or no?
042	LUK	020	023	He perceaved their craftynes and sayde vnto them: why tept ye me?
042	LUK	020	024	Shewe me a peny.  Whose ymage and superscripcio hath it?  They answered and sayde: Cesars.
042	LUK	020	025	And he sayde vnto them: Geve then vnto Cesar that which belongeth vnto Cesar: and to God that which pertayneth to God.
042	LUK	020	026	And they coulde not reprove his sayinge before the people.  But they marvayled at his answer and helde their peace.
042	LUK	020	027	Then came to him certayne of the Saduces which denye that ther is eny resurreccio.  And they axed him
042	LUK	020	028	sayinge: Master Moses wrote vnto vs if eny mannes brother dye havinge a wyfe and the same dye with out yssue: that then his brother shuld take his wyfe and reyse vp seede vnto his brother.
042	LUK	020	029	Ther were seven brethren and the fyrste toke a wyfe and dyed with out children.
042	LUK	020	030	And the seconde toke the wyfe and he dyed chyldlesse.
042	LUK	020	031	And the thyrde toke her and in lyke wyse the resydue of the seven and leeft no chyldren be hynde them and dyed.
042	LUK	020	032	Last of all the woma dyed also.
042	LUK	020	033	Now at the resurreccio whose wyfe of them shall she be?  For seven had her to wyfe.
042	LUK	020	034	Iesus answered and sayde vnto them.  The chyldre of this worlde mary wyves and are maryed
042	LUK	020	035	but they which shalbe made worthy to enioye that worlde and the resurreccion from deeth nether mary wyves nether are maryed
042	LUK	020	036	nor yet can dye eny moare.  For they are equall vnto the angels: and are the sonnes of God in as moche as they are the chyldre of the resurreccion.
042	LUK	020	037	And that the deed shall ryse agayne even Moses signified besydes the busshe when he sayde: the Lorde God of Adraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Iacob.
042	LUK	020	038	For he is not the God of the deed but of them which live.  For all live in him.
042	LUK	020	039	Then certayne of the Pharises answered and sayde: Master thou hast well sayde.
042	LUK	020	040	And after that durst they not axe him eny question at all.
042	LUK	020	041	Then sayde he vnto them: how saye they that Christ is Davids sonne?
042	LUK	020	042	And David him selfe sayth in the boke of the Psalmes: The Lorde sayde vnto my Lorde syt on my right honde
042	LUK	020	043	tyll I make thine enemys thy fothe stole.
042	LUK	020	044	Seinge David calleth him Lorde: How is he then his sonne.
042	LUK	020	045	Then in the audience of all the people he sayde vnto his disciples
042	LUK	020	046	beware of the Scribes which desyre to goo in longe clothinge: and love gretynges in the markets and the hyest seates in the synagoges and chefe roumes at feastes
042	LUK	020	047	which devoure widdowes houses and that vnder a coloure of longe prayinge: the same shall receave greater damnacion.
042	LUK	021	001	As he behelde he sawe the ryche men how they cast in their offeringes into the treasury.
042	LUK	021	002	And he sawe also a certayne povre widdowe which cast in thyther two mites.
042	LUK	021	003	And he sayde: of a trueth I saye vnto you this poore wyddowe hath put in moare then they all.
042	LUK	021	004	For they all have of their superfluyte added vnto the offerynge of God: but she of her penury hath cast in all the substaunce that she had.
042	LUK	021	005	As some spake of the teple how it was garnesshed with goodly stones and iewels he sayde.
042	LUK	021	006	The dayes will come whe of these thynges which ye se shall not be lefte stone apon stone that shall not be throwen doune.
042	LUK	021	007	And they axed him sayinge: Master whe shall these thinges be and what signe will therbe whe suche thinges shall come to passe.
042	LUK	021	008	And he sayd: take hede that ye be not deceaved.  For many will come in my name saying: I am he: and the tyme draweth neare.  Folowe ye not them therfore.
042	LUK	021	009	But when ye heare of warre and of dissencion: be not afrayd.  For these thinges must fyrst come: but the ende foloweth not by and by.
042	LUK	021	010	Then sayd he vnto the: Nacion shall ryse agaynst nacion and kingdom agaynst kyngdome
042	LUK	021	011	and greate erthquakes shall be in all quarters and honger and pestilence: and fearfull thinges.  And greate signes shall therbe from heven.
042	LUK	021	012	But before all these they shall laye their hondes on you and persecute you delyueringe you vp to the sinagoges and into preson and bringe you before kynges and rulers for my names sake.
042	LUK	021	013	And this shall chaunce you for a testimoniall.
042	LUK	021	014	Let it sticke therfore faste in youre hertes not once to stody before what ye shall answere:
042	LUK	021	015	for I will geve you a mouth and wisdome where agaynste all youre adversarys shall not be able to speake nor resist.
042	LUK	021	016	Ye and ye shalbe betrayed of youre fathers and mothers and of youre brethren and kynsmen and lovers aud some of you shall they put to deeth.
042	LUK	021	017	And hated shall ye be of all men for my names sake.
042	LUK	021	018	Yet ther shall not one heer of youre heedes perisshe.
042	LUK	021	019	With youre pacience possesse youre soules.
042	LUK	021	020	And when ye se Ierusalem beseged with an hoste then vnderstonde that the desolacio of the same is nye.
042	LUK	021	021	Then let them which are in Iewrye flye to the mountaynes.  And let them which are in the middes of it departe oute.  And let not them that are in other countreis enter ther in.
042	LUK	021	022	For these be the dayes of vengeance to fulfill all that are writte.
042	LUK	021	023	But wo be to them that be with chylde and to them that geve sucke in those dayes: for ther shalbe greate trouble in the londe and wrath over all this people.
042	LUK	021	024	And they shall fall on the edge of the swearde and shalbe leed captive into all nacions.  And Ierusalem shalbe trooden vnder fote of the gentyls vntyll the tyme of the gentyls be fulfilled.
042	LUK	021	025	And ther shalbe signes in the sunne ad in the mone and in the starres: and in ye erth the people shalbe in soche perplexite yt they shall not tell which waye to turne them selves.  The see and the waters shall roore
042	LUK	021	026	and menes hertes shall fayle them for feare and for lokinge after thoose thinges which shall come on the erth.  For the powers of heve shall move.
042	LUK	021	027	And then shall they se the sonne of ma come in a clowde with power and greate glory.
042	LUK	021	028	When these thinges begyn to come to passe: then loke vp and lifte vp youre heddes for youre redemcion draweth neye.
042	LUK	021	029	And he shewed the a similitude: beholde ye fygge tree and all other trees
042	LUK	021	030	when they shute forth their buddes ye se and knowe of youre awne selves that sommer is then nye at hod.
042	LUK	021	031	So lyke wyse ye (when ye se these thinges come to passe) vnderstonde that the kyngdome of God is neye.
042	LUK	021	032	Verely I saye vnto you: this generacion shall not passe tyll all be fulfilled.
042	LUK	021	033	Heaven and erth shall passe: but my wordes shall not passe.
042	LUK	021	034	Take hede to youre selves lest youre hertes be overcome with surfettinge and dronkennes and cares of this worlde: and that that daye come on you vnwares.
042	LUK	021	035	For as a snare shall it come on all them that sit on the face of the erthe.
042	LUK	021	036	Watche therfore continually and praye that ye maye obtayne grace to flye all this that shall come and that ye maye stonde before the sonne of man.
042	LUK	021	037	In the daye tyme he taught in the temple and at night he went out and had abydinge in the mount olivete.
042	LUK	021	038	And all the people came in the morninge to him in the temple for to heare him.
042	LUK	022	001	The feaste of swete breed drue nye whiche is called ester
042	LUK	022	002	and the hye prestes and Scribes sought how to kyll him but they feared the people.
042	LUK	022	003	Then entred Satan into Iudas whose syr name was Iscariot (which was of the nombre of the twelve)
042	LUK	022	004	and he went his waye and comuned with the hye Prestes and officers how he might betraye him to them.
042	LUK	022	005	And they were glad: and promysed to geve him money.
042	LUK	022	006	And he consented and sought oportunite to betraye him vnto them when the people were awaye.
042	LUK	022	007	Then came ye daye of swete breed when of necessite the esterlambe must be offered.
042	LUK	022	008	And he sent Peter and Iohn sayinge: Goo and prepare vs the ester lambe that we maye eate.
042	LUK	022	009	They sayde to him.  Where wilt thou yt we prepare?
042	LUK	022	010	And he sayd vnto them.  Beholde when ye be entred into the cite ther shall a man mete you bearinge a pitcher of water him folowe into the same housse yt he entreth in
042	LUK	022	011	and saye vnto ye good ma of ye housse.  The master sayeth vnto ye: where is ye gest chamber where I shall eate myne ester lambe wt my disciples?
042	LUK	022	012	And he shall shew you a greate parloure paved.  Ther make redy.
042	LUK	022	013	And they wet and foude as he had sayd vnto the: and made redy ye ester lambe.
042	LUK	022	014	And when the houre was come he sate doune and the twelve Apostles with him.
042	LUK	022	015	And he sayde vnto them: I have inwardly desyred to eate this ester lambe with you before yt I suffre.
042	LUK	022	016	For I saye vnto you: hence forthe I will not eate of it eny moore vntill it be fulfilled in the kingdome of God.
042	LUK	022	017	And he toke the cup and gave thankes and sayde.  Take this and devyde it amonge you.
042	LUK	022	018	For I saye vnto you: I will not drinke of the frute of the vyne vntill the kingdome of God be come.
042	LUK	022	019	And he toke breed gave thankes and gave to them sayinge: This is my body which is geven for you.  This do in the remembraunce of me.
042	LUK	022	020	Lykewyse also when they had supped he toke the cup sayinge: This cup is the newe testament in my bloud which shall for you be shedde.
042	LUK	022	021	Yet beholde the honde of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table.
042	LUK	022	022	And ye sonne of man goeth as it is appoynted: But wo be to yt man by whom he is betrayed.
042	LUK	022	023	And they began to enquyre amoge them selves which of them it shuld be that shuld do that.
042	LUK	022	024	And ther was a stryfe amoge the which of them shuld be taken for the greatest.
042	LUK	022	025	And he sayde vnto them: the kynges of the getyls raygne over them and they that beare rule over them are called gracious lordes.
042	LUK	022	026	But ye shall not be so.  But he that is greatest amonge you shalbe as the yongest: and he that is chefe shalbe as the minister.
042	LUK	022	027	For whether is greater he that sitteth at meate: or he that serveth?  Is not he that sitteth at meate?  And I am amoge you as he that ministreth.
042	LUK	022	028	Ye are they which have bidden with me in my temptacions.
042	LUK	022	029	And I apoynt vnto you a kyngdome as my father hath appoynted to me:
042	LUK	022	030	that ye maye eate and drynke at my table in my kyngdome and sit on seates and iudge the twelve tribes of Israell.
042	LUK	022	031	And the Lorde sayde: Simon Simon beholde Satan hath desired you to sifte you as it were wheate:
042	LUK	022	032	bnt I have prayed for the that thy faith fayle not.  And when thou arte converted strengthe thy brethre.
042	LUK	022	033	And he sayd vnto him.  Lorde I am redy to go with the in to preson and to deth.
042	LUK	022	034	And he sayde: I tell the Peter the cocke shall not crowe this daye tyll thou have thryse denyed yt thou knewest me.
042	LUK	022	035	And he sayde vnto them: when I sent you with out wallet and scripe and shoes?  lacked ye eny thinge?  And they sayd no.
042	LUK	022	036	And he sayde to them: but nowe he that hath a wallet let him take it vp and lykewyse his scrippe.  And he that hath no swearde let him sell his coote and bye one.
042	LUK	022	037	For I saye vnto you that yet that which is written must be performed in me: even with the wycked was he nombred.  For those thinges which are written of me have an ende.
042	LUK	022	038	And they sayde: Lorde beholde here are two sweardes.  And he sayde vnto them: it is ynough.
042	LUK	022	039	And he came out and went as he was wote to mounte olivete.  And the disciples folowed him.
042	LUK	022	040	And when he came to the place he sayde to the: praye lest ye fall into temptacio.
042	LUK	022	041	And he gate him selfe from them about a stones cast and kneled doune and prayed
042	LUK	022	042	sayinge: Father yf thou wilt withdrawe this cup fro me.  Neverthelesse not my will but thyne be be fulfilled.
042	LUK	022	043	And ther appered an angell vnto him from heaven confortinge him.
042	LUK	022	044	And he was in an agonye and prayed somwhat longer.  And hys sweate was lyke droppes of bloud tricklynge doune to the grounde.
042	LUK	022	045	And he rose vp from prayer and came to his disciples and foude them slepinge for sorowe
042	LUK	022	046	and sayde vnto them: Why slepe ye?  Ryse and praye lest ye fall into temptacion.
042	LUK	022	047	Whill he yet spake: beholde ther came a company and he that was called Iudas one of the twelve wet before them and preased nye vnto Iesus to kysse him.
042	LUK	022	048	And Iesus sayd vnto him: Iudas betrayest thou ye sonne of man with a kysse?
042	LUK	022	049	When they which were about him sawe what wolde folow they sayde vnto him.  Lorde shall we smite with swearde.
042	LUK	022	050	And one of them smote a servaut of ye hiest preste of all and smote of his right eare.
042	LUK	022	051	And Iesus answered and sayd: Soffre ye thus farre forthe.  And he touched his eare and healed him.
042	LUK	022	052	Then Iesus sayde vnto the hye prestes and rulers of the temple and the elders which were come to him.  Be ye come out as vnto a thefe with sweardes and staves?
042	LUK	022	053	When I was dayly with you in the teple ye stretched not forth hondes agaynst me.  But this is even youre very houre and the power of darcknes.
042	LUK	022	054	Then toke they him and ledde him and brought him to the hye prestes housse.  And peter folowed a farre of.
042	LUK	022	055	When they had kyndled a fyre in the middes of the palys and were set doune to geder Peter also sate doune amonge them.
042	LUK	022	056	And wone of the wenches behelde him as he sate by the fyer and set good eyesight on him and sayde: this same was also with him.
042	LUK	022	057	Then he denyed hym sayinge: woman I knowe him not
042	LUK	022	058	And after a lytell whyle another sawe him and sayde: thou arte also of them.  And Peter sayd man I am not.
042	LUK	022	059	And aboute the space of an houre after another affirmed sayinge: verely even this felowe was with hym for he is of Galile
042	LUK	022	060	and Peter sayde: ma I woote not what thou sayest.  And immediatly whyll he yet spake the cocke crewe.
042	LUK	022	061	And the Lorde tourned backe and loked apon Peter.  And Peter remembred the wordes of the Lorde how he sayde vnto him before ye cocke crowe thou shalt denye me thryse.
042	LUK	022	062	And Peter went out and wepte bitterly.
042	LUK	022	063	And the men that stode about Iesus mocked him and smoote him
042	LUK	022	064	and blyndfolded him and smoote his face.  And axed him sayinge: arede who it is that smoote ye?
042	LUK	022	065	And many other thinges despytfullye sayd they agaynst him.
042	LUK	022	066	And assone as it was daye the elders of the people and the hye prestes and scribes came to gedder and ledde him into their counsell sayinge:
042	LUK	022	067	arte thou very Christ?  tell vs.  And he sayde vnto the: yf I shall tell you ye will not beleve
042	LUK	022	068	And yf also I axe you ye will not answere me or let me goo.
042	LUK	022	069	Herafter shall the sonne of man sit on the ryght honde of the power of God.
042	LUK	022	070	Then sayde they all: Arte thou then the sonne of God?  He sayd to them: ye saye yt I am.
042	LUK	022	071	Then sayde they: what nede we eny further witnes?  We oure selves have herde of his awne mouthe.
042	LUK	023	001	And the whole multitude of them arose and ledde him vnto Pylate.
042	LUK	023	002	And they beganne to accuse him sayinge: We have founde this felowe pervertynge the people and forbiddynge to paye tribute to Cesar: sayinge that he is Christ a kynge.
042	LUK	023	003	And Pylate apposed him sayinge: arte thou the kynge of the iewes?  He answered him and sayde: thou sayest it.
042	LUK	023	004	Then sayde Pylate to the hye prestes and to the people: I fynde noo faute in this man.
042	LUK	023	005	And they were the moore fearce sayinge.  He moveth the people teachynge thorowout all Iewry and beganne at Galile even to this place.
042	LUK	023	006	When Pilate hearde mencion of Galile he axed whether the ma were of Galile.
042	LUK	023	007	And assone as he knewe that he was of Herodes iurisdiccion he sent him to Herode which was also at Ierusalem in those dayes.
042	LUK	023	008	And when Herode sawe Iesus he was excedinglie gladde.  For he was desyrous to se him of a longe season because he had hearde many thinges of him and trusted to have sene some myracle done by him.
042	LUK	023	009	Then questeoned he with him of many thinges.  But he answered him not one worde.
042	LUK	023	010	The hye prestes and scribes stode forthe and accused him straytly.
042	LUK	023	011	And Herod wt his men of warre despysed him and mocked him and arayed him in whyte and sent him agayne to Pylate.
042	LUK	023	012	And the same daye Pylate and Herod were made frendes togeder.  For before they were at variaunce.
042	LUK	023	013	And Pylate called to geder the hye prestes and the rulers and the people
042	LUK	023	014	and sayde vnto them: Ye have brought this man vnto me as one that perverted the people.  And beholde I have examined him before you and have founde no faute in this man of those thinges where of ye accuse him.
042	LUK	023	015	No nor yet Herode.  For I sent you to him: and lo no thinge worthy of deeth is done to him.
042	LUK	023	016	I will therfore chasten him and let him lowsse.
042	LUK	023	017	For of necessite he must have let one lowse vnto them at that feast.
042	LUK	023	018	And all the people cryed at once sayinge: awaye with him and delyvre to vs Barrabas:
042	LUK	023	019	which for insurrccion made in the cite and morther was cast into preson.
042	LUK	023	020	Pylate spake agayne to them willynge to let Iesus lowse.
042	LUK	023	021	And they cryed sayinge: Crucify him Crucify him
042	LUK	023	022	He sayde vnto them the thyrde tyme.  What evyll hath he done?  I fynde no cause of deeth in him.  I will therfore chasten him and let him lowse.
042	LUK	023	023	And they cryed with loude voyce and required that he myght be crucifyed.  And the voyce of them and of the hye Prestes prevayled.
042	LUK	023	024	And Pylate gave sentence that it shuld be as they required
042	LUK	023	025	and let lowse vnto them him that for insurreccion and morther was cast into preson whom they desyred: and delyvered Iesus to do with him what they wolde.
042	LUK	023	026	And as they ledde him awaye they caught one Symon of Syrene commynge out of the felde: and on him layde they the crosse to beare it after Iesus.
042	LUK	023	027	And ther folowed him a greate company of people and of wemen which weme bewayled and lamented him.
042	LUK	023	028	But Iesus turned backe vnto them and sayde: Doughters of Ierusalem wepe not for me: but wepe for youre selves and for youre chyldren.
042	LUK	023	029	For beholde the dayes will come when men shall saye: happy are the baren and the wombes that never bare and the pappes which never gave sucke.
042	LUK	023	030	Then shall they beginne to saye to the mountaynes fall on vs: and to the hilles cover vs.
042	LUK	023	031	For yf they do this to a grene tree what shalbe done to the drye?
042	LUK	023	032	And ther were two evyll doers ledde with him to be slayne.
042	LUK	023	033	And when they were come to the place which is called Calvary there they crucified him and the evyll doers one on ryght honde and the other on the lefte.
042	LUK	023	034	Then sayde Iesus: father forgeve them for they woot not what they do.  And they parted his rayment and cast loottes.
042	LUK	023	035	And the people stode and behelde.  And the rulers mocked him with thee saying: he holpe other men let him helpe him selfe yf he be Christ the chosen of god.
042	LUK	023	036	The soudiers also mocked him and came and gave him veneger
042	LUK	023	037	and sayde: yf thou be that kynge of ye Iewes save thy silfe.
042	LUK	023	038	And his superscripcio was writte over him in greke in latine and Ebreu: This is the kynge of the Iewes.
042	LUK	023	039	And one of the evyll doers which hanged rayled on him sayinge: If thou be Christ save thy selfe and vs.
042	LUK	023	040	The other answered and rebuked him sayinge.  Net herfearest thou god because thou arte in the same damnacion?
042	LUK	023	041	We are ryghteously punesshed for we receave accordynge to oure dedes: But this man hath done nothinge amysse.
042	LUK	023	042	And he sayde vnto Iesus: Lorde remember me when thou comest into thy kyngdome.
042	LUK	023	043	And Iesus sayde vnto him: Verely I saye vnto the to daye shalt thou be with me in Paradyse.
042	LUK	023	044	And it was about the sixt houre.  And ther came a darcknes over all the londe vntyll ye nynth houre
042	LUK	023	045	and the sonne was darckened.  And the vayle of the temple dyd rent even thorow the myddes.
042	LUK	023	046	And Iesus cryed with a greate voyce and sayd: Father into thy hondes I comende my sprete.  And when he thus had sayd he gave vp the goost.
042	LUK	023	047	When ye Centurion sawe what had happened he glorified God sayinge: Of a surtie this man was perfecte.
042	LUK	023	048	And all the people that came to geder to that sight beholdynge the thinges which were done: smoote their bestes and returned home.
042	LUK	023	049	And all his acquayntaunce and the wemen that folowed him from Galile stode a farre of beholdynge these thinges.
042	LUK	023	050	And beholde ther was a man named Ioseph a councelloure and was a good man and a iuste
042	LUK	023	051	and dyd not consent to the counsell and dede of them which was of Aramathia a cite of the Iewes: which same also wayted for ye kyngdome of God:
042	LUK	023	052	he went vnto Pilate and begged the boddy of Iesus
042	LUK	023	053	and toke it doune and wrapped it in a lynnen clooth and layed it in an hewen toumbe wherin was never man before layed.
042	LUK	023	054	And that daye was ye Saboth even and the Saboth drue on.
042	LUK	023	055	The wemen that folowed after which came with him from Galile behelde the sepulcre and how his body was layed.
042	LUK	023	056	And they returned and prepared odoures and oyntmetes: but rested the Saboth daye accordynge to the commaundement.
042	LUK	024	001	On the morowe after the saboth erly in the morninge they came vnto the toumbe and brought the odoures which they had prepared and other wemen with them
042	LUK	024	002	And they founde the stone rouled awaye fro the sepulcre
042	LUK	024	003	and went in: but founde not the body of the Lorde Iesu.
042	LUK	024	004	And it happened as they were amased therat: Beholde two men stode by them in shynynge vestures.
042	LUK	024	005	And as they were a frayde and bowed doune their faces to the erth: they sayd to them: why seke ye the lyvinge amonge the deed?
042	LUK	024	006	He is not here: but is rysen.  Remember how he spake vnto you when he was yet with you in Galile
042	LUK	024	007	sayinge: that the sonne of man must be delyvered into the hondes of synfull men and be crucified and the thyrde daye ryse agayne.
042	LUK	024	008	And they remembred his wordes
042	LUK	024	009	and returned from the sepulcre and tolde all these thinges vnto the eleven and to all the remanaunt.
042	LUK	024	010	It was Mary Magdalen and Ioanna and Mary Iacobi and other that were with the which tolde these thinges vnto the Apostles
042	LUK	024	011	and their wordes semed vnto them fayned thinges nether beleved they them.
042	LUK	024	012	Then aroose Peter and ran vnto the sepulcre and stouped in and sawe the lynnen cloothes layde by them selfe and departed wondrynge in him selfe at that which had happened.
042	LUK	024	013	And beholde two of them went that same daye to a toune which was fro Ierusalem about thre scoore for longes called Emaus:
042	LUK	024	014	and they talked togeder of all these thinges that had happened.
042	LUK	024	015	And it chaunsed as they comened togeder and reasoned that Iesus him selfe drue neare and went with them.
042	LUK	024	016	But their eyes were holden that they coulde not knowe him.
042	LUK	024	017	And he sayde vnto them: What maner of comunicacions are these that ye have one to another as ye walke and are sadde.
042	LUK	024	018	And the one of them named Cleophas answered and sayd vnto him: arte thou only a straunger in Ierusalem and haste not knowen the thinges which have chaunsed therin in these dayes?
042	LUK	024	019	To whom he sayd: what thinges?  And they sayd vnto him: of Iesus of Nazareth which was a Prophet myghtie in dede and worde before god and all the people.
042	LUK	024	020	And how the hye prestes and oure rulers delyvered him to be condempned to deeth: and have crucified him.
042	LUK	024	021	But we trusted that it shuld have bene he that shuld have delyvered Israel.  And as touchynge all these thinges to daye is even the thyrd daye that they were done.
042	LUK	024	022	Ye and certayne wemen also of oure company made vs astonyed which came erly vnto the sepulcre
042	LUK	024	023	and founde not his boddy: and came sayinge that they had sene a vision of angels which sayde that he was alyve.
042	LUK	024	024	And certayne of them which were with vs went their waye to the sepulcre and founde it even so as the wemen had sayde: but him they sawe not.
042	LUK	024	025	And he sayde vnto the: O foles and slowe of herte to beleve all yt the prophetes have spoken.
042	LUK	024	026	Ought not Christ to have suffred these thinges and to enter into his glory?
042	LUK	024	027	And he began at Moses and at all the prophetes and interpreted vnto them in all scriptures which were wrytten of him.
042	LUK	024	028	And they drue neye vnto the toune wich they went to.  And he made as though he wolde have gone further.
042	LUK	024	029	But they constrayned him sayinge: abyde with vs for it draweth towardes nyght and the daye is farre passed.  And he went in to tary with the.
042	LUK	024	030	And it came to passe as he sate at meate wt them he toke breed blessed it brake and gave to them.
042	LUK	024	031	And their eyes were openned and they knewe him: and he vnnisshed out of their syght.
042	LUK	024	032	And they sayde betwene them selves: dyd not oure hertes burne with in vs whyll he talked with vs by the waye and as he opened to vs the scriptures?
042	LUK	024	033	And they roose vp the same houre and returned agayne to Ierusalem and founde the eleven gadered to geder and them that were with them which
042	LUK	024	034	sayde: the Lorde is rysen in dede and hath apered to Simon.
042	LUK	024	035	And they tolde what thinges was done in the waye and how they knewe him in breakynge of breed.
042	LUK	024	036	As they thus spake Iesus him selfe stode in ye myddes of them and sayde vnto them: peace be with you.
042	LUK	024	037	And they were abasshed and afrayde supposinge yt they had sene a sprete
042	LUK	024	038	And he sayde vnto the: Why are ye troubled and why do thoughtes aryse in youre hertes?
042	LUK	024	039	Beholde my hondes and my fete that it is even my selfe.  Handle me and se: for spretes have not flesshe and bones as ye se me have.
042	LUK	024	040	And when he had thus spoken he shewed them his hondes and his fete.
042	LUK	024	041	And whyll they yet beleved not for ioye and wondred he sayde vnto the: Have ye here eny meate?
042	LUK	024	042	And they gave him a pece of a broyled fisshe and of an hony combe.
042	LUK	024	043	And he toke it and ate it before them.
042	LUK	024	044	And he sayde vnto the.  These are the wordes which I spake vnto you whyll I was yet with you: that all must be fulfilled which were written of me in the lawe of Moses and in the Prophetes and in the Psalmes.
042	LUK	024	045	Then openned he their wyttes that they myght vnderstond the scriptures
042	LUK	024	046	and sayde vnto them.  Thus is it written and thus it behoved Christ to suffre and to ryse agayne from deeth the thyrde daye
042	LUK	024	047	and that repentaunce and remission of synnes shuld be preached in his name amonge all nacions and must beginne at Ierusalem.
042	LUK	024	048	And ye are witnesses of these thinges.
042	LUK	024	049	And beholde I will sende the promes of my father apon you.  But tary ye in ye cite of Ierusalem vntyll ye be endewed with power from an hye.
042	LUK	024	050	And he ledde the out into Bethany and lyfte vp his hondes and blest them.
042	LUK	024	051	And it cam to passe as he blessed the he departed from the and was caryed vp in to heven.
042	LUK	024	052	And they worshipped him and returned to Ierusalem with greate ioye
042	LUK	024	053	and were continually in the temple praysinge and laudinge God.  Amen.

# BOOK	043	JOH	John	John
043	JOH	001	001	In the beginnynge was the worde and the worde was with God: and the worde was God.
043	JOH	001	002	The same was in the beginnynge with God.
043	JOH	001	003	All thinges were made by it and with out it was made nothinge that was made.
043	JOH	001	004	In it was lyfe and the lyfe was ye lyght of men
043	JOH	001	005	and the lyght shyneth in the darcknes but the darcknes comprehended it not.
043	JOH	001	006	There was a man sent from God whose name was Iohn.
043	JOH	001	007	The same cam as a witnes to beare witnes of the lyght that all men through him myght beleve.
043	JOH	001	008	He was not that lyght: but to beare witnes of the lyght.
043	JOH	001	009	That was a true lyght which lyghteth all men that come into the worlde.
043	JOH	001	010	He was in ye worlde and the worlde was made by him: and yet the worlde knewe him not.
043	JOH	001	011	He cam amonge his (awne) and his awne receaved him not.
043	JOH	001	012	But as meny as receaved him to them he gave power to be the sonnes of God in yt they beleved on his name:
043	JOH	001	013	which were borne not of bloude nor of the will of the flesshe nor yet of the will of man: but of God.
043	JOH	001	014	And the worde was made flesshe and dwelt amonge vs and we sawe the glory of it as the glory of the only begotten sonne of ye father which worde was full of grace and verite.
043	JOH	001	015	Iohn bare witnes of him and cryed sayinge: This was he of whome I spake he that cometh after me was before me because he was yer then I.
043	JOH	001	016	And of his fulnes have all we receaved even (grace) for grace.
043	JOH	001	017	For the lawe was geven by Moses but grace and truthe came by Iesus Christ.
043	JOH	001	018	No ma hath sene God at eny tyme.  The only begotte sonne which is in ye bosome of ye father he hath declared him.
043	JOH	001	019	And this is the recorde of Iohn: When the Iewes sent Prestes and Levites from Ierusalem to axe him what arte thou?
043	JOH	001	020	And he confessed and denyed not and sayde playnly: I am not Christ.
043	JOH	001	021	And they axed him: what then?  arte thou Helyas?  And he sayde: I am not.  Arte thou a Prophete?  And he answered no.
043	JOH	001	022	Then sayd they vnto him: what arte thou that we maye geve an answer to them that sent vs: What sayest thou of thy selfe?
043	JOH	001	023	He sayde: I am the voyce of a cryar in the wyldernes make strayght the waye of the Lorde as sayde the Prophete Esaias.
043	JOH	001	024	And they which were sent were of the pharises.
043	JOH	001	025	And they axed him and sayde vnto him: why baptisest thou then yf thou be not Christ nor Helyas nether a Prophet?
043	JOH	001	026	Iohn answered them sayinge: I baptise with water: but one is come amonge you whom ye knowe not
043	JOH	001	027	he it is that cometh after me whiche was before me whose sho latchet I am not worthy to vnlose.
043	JOH	001	028	These thinges were done in Bethabara beyonde Iordan where Iohn dyd baptyse.
043	JOH	001	029	The nexte daye Iohn sawe Iesus commyge vnto him and sayde: beholde the lambe of God which taketh awaye the synne of the worlde.
043	JOH	001	030	This is he of whom I sayde.  After me cometh a man which was before me for he was yer then I
043	JOH	001	031	and I knew him not: but that he shuld be declared to Israell therfore am I come baptisynge with water.
043	JOH	001	032	And Iohn bare recorde sayinge: I sawe the sprete descende from heven lyke vnto a dove and abyde apon him
043	JOH	001	033	and I knewe him not.  But he that sent me to baptise in water the same sayde vnto me: apon whom thou shalt se the sprete descende and tary styll on him the same is he which baptiseth with the holy goost.
043	JOH	001	034	And I sawe and bare recorde that this is the sonne of God.
043	JOH	001	035	The next daye after Iohn stode agayne and two of his disciples.
043	JOH	001	036	And he behelde Iesus as he walked by and sayde: beholde the lambe of God.
043	JOH	001	037	And the two disciples hearde him speake and folowed Iesus.
043	JOH	001	038	And Iesus turned about and sawe them folowe and sayde vnto them: what seke ye?  They sayde vnto him: Rabbi (which is to saye by interpretacion Master) where dwellest thou?
043	JOH	001	039	He sayde vnto them: come and se.  They came and sawe where he dwelt: and abode with him that daye.  For it was about the tenthe houre.
043	JOH	001	040	One of the two which hearde Iohn speake and folowed Iesus was Andrew Simon Peters brother.
043	JOH	001	041	The same founde his brother Simon fyrst and sayde vnto him: we have founde Messias which is by interpretacion annoynted:
043	JOH	001	042	and brought him to Iesus.  And Iesus behelde him and sayde: thou arte Simon the sonne of Ionas thou shalt be called Cephas: which is by interpretacion a stone.
043	JOH	001	043	The daye folowynge Iesus wolde goo into Galile and founde Philip and sayde vnto him folowe me.
043	JOH	001	044	Philip was of Bethsaida the cite of Andrew and Peter.
043	JOH	001	045	And Philip founde Nathanael and sayde vnto him.  We have founde him of whom Moses in the lawe and the prophetes dyd wryte.  Iesus the sonne of Ioseph of Nazareth.
043	JOH	001	046	And Nathanael sayde vnto him: can ther eny good thinge come out of Nazareth?  Philip sayde to him: come and se.
043	JOH	001	047	Iesus sawe Nathanael commynge to him and sayde of him.  Beholde a ryght Israelite in who is no gyle.
043	JOH	001	048	Nathanael sayd vnto him: where knewest thou me?  Iesus answered and sayde vnto him: Before that Philip called the when thou wast vnder ye fygge tree I sawe the.
043	JOH	001	049	Nathanael answered and sayde vnto him: Rabbi thou arte the sonne of God thou arte the kynge of Israel.
043	JOH	001	050	Iesus answered and sayd vnto him: Because I sayde vnto the I sawe the vnder the fygge tree thou belevest.  Thou shalt se greater thinges then these.
043	JOH	001	051	And he sayde vnto him: Verely verely I saye vnto you: herafter shall ye se heven open and the angels of God ascendynge and descendynge over the sonne of man.
043	JOH	002	001	And the thryde daye was ther a mariage in Cana a cite of Galile: and the mother of Iesus was there.
043	JOH	002	002	And Iesus was called also and his disciples vnto the mariage.
043	JOH	002	003	And when the wyne fayled the mother of Iesus sayde vnto him: they have no wyne.
043	JOH	002	004	Iesus sayde vnto her: woman what have I to do with the?  myne houre is not yet come.
043	JOH	002	005	His mother sayde vnto the ministres: whatsoever he sayeth vnto you do it.
043	JOH	002	006	And therwere stondynge theare sixe water pottes of stone after ye maner of the purifyinge of ye Iewes contaynynge two or thre fyrkins a pece.
043	JOH	002	007	And Iesus sayde vnto them: fyll the water pottes with water.  And they fylled them vp to the brym.
043	JOH	002	008	And he sayde vnto them: drawe out now and beare vnto the governer of the feaste.  And they bare it.
043	JOH	002	009	When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was turned vnto wyne and knewe not whence it was (but the ministres which drue the water knew).  He called the brydegrome
043	JOH	002	010	and sayde vnto him.  All men at the beginnynge set forth good wyne and when men be dronke then that which is worsse.  But thou hast kept backe the good wyne vntyll now.
043	JOH	002	011	This beginnynge of miracles dyd Iesus in Cana of Galile and shewed his glory and his disciples beleved on him.
043	JOH	002	012	After that he descended in to Capernaum and his mother and his brethren and his disciples: but contynued not manye dayes there.
043	JOH	002	013	And the Iewes ester was even at honde and Iesus went vp to Ierusalem
043	JOH	002	014	and founde syttynge in the temple those that solde oxen and shepe and doves and chaungers of money.
043	JOH	002	015	And he made a scourge of small cordes and drave them all out of the temple with the shepe and oxen and powred oute the changers money and overthrue the tables
043	JOH	002	016	and sayde vnto them that solde doves: Have these thinges hence and make not my fathers housse an housse of marchaundyse.
043	JOH	002	017	And his disciples remembred how yt it was wrytten: the zele of thyne housse hath even eaten me.
043	JOH	002	018	Then answered the Iewes and sayde vnto him: what token shewest thou vnto vs seynge that thou dost these thinges?
043	JOH	002	019	Iesus answered and sayd vnto them: destroye this temple and in thre dayes I will reare it vp agayne.
043	JOH	002	020	Then sayde the Iewes: xlvi.  yeares was this temple abuyldinge: and wylt thou reare it vp in thre dayes?
043	JOH	002	021	But he spake of the temple of his body.
043	JOH	002	022	Assone therfore as he was rysen from deeth agayne his disciples remembred that he thus sayde.  And they beleved the scripture and the wordes which Iesus had sayde.
043	JOH	002	023	When he was at Ierusalem at ester in the feaste many beleved on his name when they sawe his miracles which he dyd.
043	JOH	002	024	But Iesus put not him selfe in their hondes because he knewe all men
043	JOH	002	025	and neded not that eny man shuld testify of man.  For he knewe what was in man.
043	JOH	003	001	Ther was a man of the pharises named Nicodemus a ruler amonge ye Iewes.
043	JOH	003	002	The same cam to Iesus by nyght and sayde vnto him: Rabbi we knowe that thou arte a teacher whiche arte come from God.  For no man coulde do suche miracles as thou doest except God were with him.
043	JOH	003	003	Iesus answered and sayde vnto him: Verely verely I saye vnto the: except a man be boren a newe he cannot se the kyngdom of God.
043	JOH	003	004	Nicodemus sayde vnto him: how can a man be boren when he is olde?  can he enter into his moders wombe and be boren agayne?
043	JOH	003	005	Iesus answered: verely verely I saye vnto the: except that a man be boren of water and of ye sprete he cannot enter into the kyngdome of god.
043	JOH	003	006	That which is boren of the flesshe is flesshe: and that which is boren of the sprete is sprete.
043	JOH	003	007	Marvayle not that I sayd to the ye must be boren a newe.
043	JOH	003	008	The wynde bloweth where he listeth and thou hearest his sounde: but canst not tell whence he cometh and whether he goeth.  So is every man that is boren of the sprete.
043	JOH	003	009	And Nicodemus answered and sayde vnto him: how can these thinges be?
043	JOH	003	010	Iesus answered and sayde vnto him: arte thou a master in Israel and knowest not these thinges?
043	JOH	003	011	Verely verely I saye vnto the we speake that we knowe and testify that we have sene: and ye receave not oure witnes.
043	JOH	003	012	Yf when I tell you erthely thinges ye beleve not: how shuld ye beleve yf I shall tell you of hevenly thinges?
043	JOH	003	013	And no man ascendeth vp to heaven but he that came doune from heaven that is to saye the sonne of man which is in heaven.
043	JOH	003	014	And as Moses lifte vp the serpent in the wyldernes even so must the sonne of man be lifte vp
043	JOH	003	015	that none that beleveth in him perisshe: but have eternall lyfe.
043	JOH	003	016	For God so loveth the worlde yt he hath geven his only sonne that none that beleve in him shuld perisshe: but shuld have everlastinge lyfe.
043	JOH	003	017	For God sent not his sonne into the worlde to condepne the worlde: but that the worlde through him might be saved.
043	JOH	003	018	He that beleveth on him shall not be condepned.  But he that beleveth not is condempned all redy be cause he beleveth not in the name of the only sonne of God.
043	JOH	003	019	And this is the condempnacion: that light is come into the worlde and the me loved darcknes more then light because their dedes were evill.
043	JOH	003	020	For every man that evyll doeth hateth the light: nether commeth to light lest his dedes shuld be reproved.
043	JOH	003	021	But he that doth truth commeth to the light that his dedes might be knowen how that they are wrought in God.
043	JOH	003	022	After these thinges cam Iesus and his disciples into the Iewes londe and ther he haunted with them and baptised.
043	JOH	003	023	And Iohn also baptised in Enon besydes Salim because ther was moche water there and they came and were baptised.
043	JOH	003	024	For Iohn was not yet cast into preson.
043	JOH	003	025	And ther arose a questio bitwene Iohns disciples and the Iewes about purifiynge.
043	JOH	003	026	And they came vnto Iohn and sayde vnto him: Rabbi he that was with the beyonde Iordan to whom thou barest witnes.  Beholde the same baptyseth and all me come to him.
043	JOH	003	027	Iohn answered and sayde: a man can receave no thinge at all except it be geve him fro heaven.
043	JOH	003	028	Ye youre selves are witnesses how that I sayde: I am not Christ but am sent before him.
043	JOH	003	029	He that hath the bryde is the brydegrome.  But the frende of the brydegrome which stondeth by and heareth him reioyseth greately of the brydgromes voyce.  Tis my ioye is fulfilled.
043	JOH	003	030	He must increace: and I muste decreace.
043	JOH	003	031	He that commeth from an hye is above all: He that is of ye erth is of the erth and speaketh of the erth.  He that cometh from heaven is above all
043	JOH	003	032	and what he hath sene and hearde: that he testifieth: but no man receaveth his testimonye.
043	JOH	003	033	How be it he that hath receaved hys testimonye hath set to his seale that God is true.
043	JOH	003	034	For he whom God hath sent speaketh the wordes of God.  For God geveth not the sprete by measure.
043	JOH	003	035	The father loveth the sonne and hath geven all thinges into his honde.
043	JOH	003	036	He that beleveth on the sonne hath everlastynge lyfe: and he that beleveth not the sonne shall not se lyfe but the wrathe of God abydeth on him.
043	JOH	004	001	Assone as the Lorde had knowledge how the Pharises had hearde that Iesus made and baptised moo disciples then Iohn
043	JOH	004	002	(though that Iesus him selfe baptised not: but his disciples)
043	JOH	004	003	he lefte Iewry and departed agayne into Galile.
043	JOH	004	004	And it was so that he must nedes goo thorowe Samaria.
043	JOH	004	005	Then came he to a cyte of Samaria called Sichar besydes the possession that Iacob gave to his sonne Ioseph.
043	JOH	004	006	And there was Iacobs well.  Iesus then weryed in his iorney sate thus on the well.  And it was about the sixte houre:
043	JOH	004	007	and there came a woman of Samaria to drawe water.  And Iesus sayde vnto her: geve me drynke.
043	JOH	004	008	For his disciples were gone awaye vnto the toune to bye meate.
043	JOH	004	009	Then sayde the woman of Samaria vnto him: how is it that thou beinge a Iewe axest drinke of me which am a Samaritane?  for the Iewes medle not with the Samaritans.
043	JOH	004	010	Iesus answered and sayde vnto hir: yf thou knewest the gyfte of God and who it is that sayeth to the geve me drynke thou woldest have axed of him and he wolde have geven the water of lyfe.
043	JOH	004	011	The woman sayde vnto him.  Syr thou hast no thinge to drawe with and the well is depe: from whence then hast thou yt water of lyfe?
043	JOH	004	012	Arte thou greater then oure father Iacob which gave vs the well and he him silfe dranke therof and his chyldren and his catell?
043	JOH	004	013	Iesus answered and sayde vnto hir: whosoever drinketh of this water shall thurst agayne.
043	JOH	004	014	But whosoever shall drinke of ye water yt I shall geve him shall never be more a thyrst: but the water that I shall geve him shalbe in him a well of water springinge vp in to everlastinge lyfe.
043	JOH	004	015	The woma sayd vnto him: Syr geve me of that water that I thyrst not nether come hedder to drawe.
043	JOH	004	016	Iesus sayde vnto her.  Go and call thy husband and come hydder.
043	JOH	004	017	The woman answered and sayde to him: I have no husband.
043	JOH	004	018	Iesus sayde to her.  Thou hast well sayd I have no husbande.  For thou haste had five husbandes and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband.  That saydest thou truely.
043	JOH	004	019	The woman sayde vnto him: Syr I perceave yt thou arte a prophet.
043	JOH	004	020	Oure fathers worshipped in this mountayne: and ye saye that in Hierusalem is the place where men ought to worshippe.
043	JOH	004	021	Iesus sayde vnto her: woman beleve me the houre cometh when ye shall nether in this moutayne nor yet at Ierusalem worshippe the father.
043	JOH	004	022	Ye worshippe ye wot not what: we knowe what we worshippe.  For salvacion cometh of the Iewes.
043	JOH	004	023	But the houre commeth and nowe is when the true worshippers shall worshippe the father in sprete and in trouthe.  For verely suche the father requyreth to worshippe him.
043	JOH	004	024	God is a sprete and they that worshippe him must worshippe him in sprete and trouthe.
043	JOH	004	025	The woman sayde vnto him: I wot well Messias shall come which is called Christ.  When he is come he will tell vs all thinges.
043	JOH	004	026	Iesus sayde vnto hir: I that speake vnto the am he.
043	JOH	004	027	And eve at that poynte came his disciples and marvelled that he talked with the woman.  Yet no man sayde vnto him: what meanest thou or why talkest thou with her?
043	JOH	004	028	The woma then lefte her waterpot and went her waye into the cite and sayde to the men.
043	JOH	004	029	Come se a man which tolde me all thinges yt ever I dyd.  Is not he Christ?
043	JOH	004	030	Then they went ont of the cite and came vnto him.
043	JOH	004	031	And in ye meane while his disciples prayed him sayinge: Master eate.
043	JOH	004	032	He sayde vnto the: I have meate to eate that ye knowe not of.
043	JOH	004	033	Then sayd ye disciples bitwene them selves: hath eny ma brought him meate?
043	JOH	004	034	Iesus sayde vnto them: my meate is to doo the will of him that sent me.  And to fynnysshe his worke.
043	JOH	004	035	Saye not ye: there are yet foure monethes and then cometh harvest?  Beholde I saye vnto you lyfte vp youre eyes and loke on ye regios: for they are whyte all redy vnto harvest.
043	JOH	004	036	And he ye repeth receaveth rewarde and gaddereth frute vnto life eternall: that bothe he that soweth and he yt repeth myght reioyse to gether.
043	JOH	004	037	And herin is the sayinge true yt one soweth and another repeth.
043	JOH	004	038	I sent you to repe yt whero ye bestowed no laboure.  Other men laboured and ye are entred into their labours.
043	JOH	004	039	Many of the Samaritas of that cyte beleved on him for ye sayinge of the woma which testified: he tolde me all thinges yt ever I dyd.
043	JOH	004	040	Then when the Samaritas were come vnto him they besought him yt he wolde tary wt the.  And he aboode there two dayes.
043	JOH	004	041	And many moo beleved because of his awne wordes
043	JOH	004	042	and sayd vnto the woman: Now we beleve not because of thy sayinge.  For we have herde him oure selves and knowe that this is even in dede Christ the savioure of the worlde.
043	JOH	004	043	After two dayes he departed thence and wet awaye into Galile.
043	JOH	004	044	And Iesus him selfe testified that a Prophete hath none honoure in his awne countre.
043	JOH	004	045	Then assone as he was come into Galile the Galileans receaved him which had sene all the thinges yt he dyd at Ierusalem at ye feast.  For they wet also vnto ye feast daye.
043	JOH	004	046	And Iesus came agayne into Cana of Galile wher he turned water into wyne.  And ther was a certayne ruler whose sonne was sicke at Capernaum.
043	JOH	004	047	Assone as the same herde that Iesus was come out of Iewry into Galile he wet vnto him and besought him yt he wolde descende and heale his sonne: For he was eve readie to dye.
043	JOH	004	048	Then sayde Iesus vnto him: excepte ye se signes and wodres ye canot beleve.
043	JOH	004	049	The ruler sayd vnto him: Syr come awaye or ever yt my chylde dye.
043	JOH	004	050	Iesus sayde vnto him goo thy waye thy sonne liveth.  And the ma beleved ye wordes yt Iesus had spoke vnto him and wet his waye.
043	JOH	004	051	And anone as he went on his waye his servantes met him and tolde him sayinge: thy chylde liveth.
043	JOH	004	052	Then enquyred he of the the houre when he begane to amende.  And they sayde vnto him: Yester daye the sevethe houre the fever lefte him.
043	JOH	004	053	And the father knew that it was the same houre in which Iesus sayde vnto him: Thy sonne liveth.  And he beleved and all his housholde.
043	JOH	004	054	Thys is agayne the seconde myracle yt Iesus dyd after he was come oute of Iewry into Galile.
043	JOH	005	001	After that ther was a feast of the Iewes and Iesus went vp to Ierusalem.
043	JOH	005	002	And ther is at Ierusalem by ye slaughterhousse a pole called in ye Ebrue toge Bethseda havinge five porches
043	JOH	005	003	in which laye a greate multitude of sicke folke of blinde halt and wyddered waytinge for the movinge of the water.
043	JOH	005	004	For an angell wet doune at a certayne ceason into ye pole and troubled ye water.  Whosoever then fyrst after the steringe of the water stepped in was made whoale of what soever disease he had.
043	JOH	005	005	And a certayne ma was theare which had bene diseased. xxxviii.  yeares
043	JOH	005	006	When Iesus sawe him lye and knewe that he now longe tyme had bene diseased he sayde vnto him.  Wilt thou be made whoale?
043	JOH	005	007	The sicke answered him: Syr I have no man whe the water is troubled to put me into the pole.  But in the meane tyme whill I am about to come another steppeth doune before me.
043	JOH	005	008	And Iesus sayde vnto him: ryse take vp thy beed and walke.
043	JOH	005	009	And immediatly the man was made whole and toke vp his beed and went.  And the same daye was the Saboth daye
043	JOH	005	010	The Iewes therfore sayde vnto him that was made whole.  It is ye Saboth daye it is not laufull for the to cary thy beed
043	JOH	005	011	He answered them: he that made me whole sayde vnto me: take vp thy beed and get the hence.
043	JOH	005	012	Then axed they him: what man is that which sayde vnto the take vp thy beed and walke.
043	JOH	005	013	And he yt was healed wist not who it was.  For Iesus had gotte him selfe awaye be cause yt ther was preace of people in ye place.
043	JOH	005	014	And after that Iesus founde him in the teple and sayd vnto him: beholde thou arte made whole synne no moore lest a worsse thinge happe vnto the.
043	JOH	005	015	The man departed and tolde ye Iewes that yt was Iesus whiche had made him whole.
043	JOH	005	016	And therfore the Iewes dyd persecute Iesus and sought the meanes to slee him because he had done these thinges on the Saboth daye.
043	JOH	005	017	And Iesus answered them: my father worketh hidder to and I worke.
043	JOH	005	018	Therfore the Iewes sought the moare to kill him not only because he had broken the Saboth: but sayde also that God was his father and made him selfe equall with God.
043	JOH	005	019	Then answered Iesus and sayde vnto them: verely verely I saye vnto you: the sonne can do no thinge of him selfe but that he seeth ye father do.  For whatsoever he doeth yt doeth the sonne also.
043	JOH	005	020	For the father loveth ye sonne and sheweth him all thinges whatsoever he him selfe doeth.  And he will shewe him greter workes then these because ye shoulde marvayle.
043	JOH	005	021	For lykwyse as the father rayseth vp ye deed and quickeneth them even so the sonne quyckeneth whom he will.
043	JOH	005	022	Nether iudgeth ye father eny ma: but hath comitted all iudgemet vnto the sonne
043	JOH	005	023	because that all men shuld honoure the sonne eve as they honoure the father.  He that honoureth not ye sonne the same honoureth not the father which hath sent him.
043	JOH	005	024	Verely verely I saye vnto you: He that heareth my wordes and beleveth on him that sent me hath everlastinge lyfe and shall not come into damnacion: but is scaped fro deth vnto lyfe.
043	JOH	005	025	Verely verely I saye vnto you: the tyme shall come and now is when the deed shall heare the voyce of the sonne of God.  And they yt heare shall live.
043	JOH	005	026	For as the father hath life in him silfe: so lyke wyse hath he geven to ye sonne to have lyfe in him silfe:
043	JOH	005	027	and hath geven him power also to iudge in that he is the sonne of man.
043	JOH	005	028	Marvayle not at this ye houre shall come in the which all yt are in the graves shall heare his voice
043	JOH	005	029	and shall come forthe: they that have done good vnto the resurreccion of lyfe: and they that have done evyll vnto the resurreccion of dampnacion.
043	JOH	005	030	I can of myne awne selfe do nothinge at all.  As I heare I iudge and my iudgemet is iust because I seke not myne awne will but the will of ye father which hath sent me.
043	JOH	005	031	Yf I beare witnes of my selfe my witnes is not true.
043	JOH	005	032	Ther is a nother that beareth witnes of me and I am sure that the witnes whiche he beareth of me is true.
043	JOH	005	033	Ye sent vnto Iohn and he bare witnes vnto the truthe.
043	JOH	005	034	But I receave not the recorde of man.  Neverthelesse these thinges I saye that ye might be safe.
043	JOH	005	035	He was a burninge and a shyninge light and ye wolde for a season have reioysed in his light.
043	JOH	005	036	But I have greater witnes then the witnes of Iohn.  For ye workes which ye father hath geve me to fynisshe: the same workes which I do beare witnes of me that ye father sent me.
043	JOH	005	037	And the father him silfe which hath sent me beareth witnes of me.  Ye have not hearde his voyce at eny tyme nor ye have sene his shape:
043	JOH	005	038	therto his wordes have ye not abydinge in you.  For whome he hath sent: him ye beleve not.
043	JOH	005	039	Searche the scriptures for in them ye thinke ye have eternall lyfe: and they are they which testify of me.
043	JOH	005	040	And yet will ye not come to me that ye might have lyfe.
043	JOH	005	041	I receave not prayse of men.
043	JOH	005	042	But I knowe you that ye have not the love of God in you
043	JOH	005	043	I am come in my fathers name and ye receave me not.  Yf another shall come in his awne name him will ye receave.
043	JOH	005	044	How can ye beleve which receave honoure one of another and seke not the honoure that commeth of God only?
043	JOH	005	045	Doo not thinke that I wyll accuse you to my father.  Ther is one that accuseth you eve Moses in whom ye trust.
043	JOH	005	046	For had ye beleved Moses ye wold have beleved me: for he wrote of me.
043	JOH	005	047	But now ye beleve not his writinge: how shall ye beleve my wordes.
043	JOH	006	001	After these thinges Iesus wet his waye over the see of Galile nye to a cyte called Tiberias.
043	JOH	006	002	And a greate multitude folowed him because they had sene his myracles which he dyd on them that were diseased.
043	JOH	006	003	And Iesus went vp into a mountayne and there he sate with his disciples.
043	JOH	006	004	And ester a feast of ye Iewes was nye.
043	JOH	006	005	Then Iesus lifte vp his eyes and sawe a greate copany come vnto him and sayde vnto Philip: whence shall we bye breed yt these might eate.
043	JOH	006	006	This he sayde to prove him: for he him sylfe knewe what he wolde do.
043	JOH	006	007	Philip answered him two hondred peny worthe of breed are not sufficient for them yt every ma have a litell.
043	JOH	006	008	Then sayde vnto him one of his disciples Andrew Simon Peters brother.
043	JOH	006	009	There ys a lad here which hath fyve barly loves and two fisshes: but what is that amoge so many?
043	JOH	006	010	And Iesus sayde.  Make the people sit doune: Ther was moche grasse in the place.  And the men sate doune in nombre about five thousande.
043	JOH	006	011	And Iesus toke the breed and gave thankes and gave to the disciples and his disciples to them that were set doune.  And lykwyse of the fysshes as moche as they wolde.
043	JOH	006	012	When they had eate ynough he sayd vnto his disciples: gadder vp the broke meate that remayneth: that nothinge be loost.
043	JOH	006	013	And they gadered it to geder and fylled twelve baskettes with the broken meate of the five barly loves which broken meate remayned vnto the that had eaten.
043	JOH	006	014	Then the men when they had sene the myracle that Iesus dyd sayde: This is of a trueth the Prophet that shuld come into the worlde.
043	JOH	006	015	When Iesus perceaved that they wolde come and take him vp to make him kinge he departed agayne into a mountayne him silfe a lone.
043	JOH	006	016	And when eve was come his disciples wet vnto the see
043	JOH	006	017	and entred into a shyppe and went over the see vnto Capernaum.  And anone it was darcke and Iesus was not come to them.
043	JOH	006	018	And ye see arose with a greate winde yt blew.
043	JOH	006	019	And when they had rowe aboute a. xxv.  or a xxx.  furlonges they sawe Iesus walke on ye see and drawe nye vnto the shyp and they were afrayed.
043	JOH	006	020	And he sayde vnto them: It is I be not a frayde.
043	JOH	006	021	Then wolde they have receaved him into the shyp and the ship was by and by at the londe whyther they went.
043	JOH	006	022	The daye folowynge the people which stode on the other syde of the see sawe that ther was none other shyp theare save yt one wher in his disciples were entred and that Iesus went not in with his disciples into the ship: but that his disciples were gone awaye alone.
043	JOH	006	023	How be it ther came other shippes from Tiberias nye vnto the place where they ate breed when the Lorde had blessed.
043	JOH	006	024	Then whe the people sawe that Iesus was not there nether his disciples they also toke shippinge and came to Caparnaum sekinge for Iesus.
043	JOH	006	025	And when they had founde him on ye other syde of ye see they sayd vnto him: Rabbi whe camest thou hidder?
043	JOH	006	026	Iesus answered them and sayde: verely verely I saye vnto you: ye seke me not because ye sawe the myracles: but because ye ate of the loves and were filled.
043	JOH	006	027	Laboure not for ye meate which perissheth but for ye meate that endureth vnto everlastynge lyfe whiche meate ye sonne of ma shall geve vnto you.  For him hath god ye father sealed.
043	JOH	006	028	Then sayd they vnto him: what shall we do that we myght worke ye workes of God?
043	JOH	006	029	Iesus answered and sayde vnto them.  This is ye worke of God that ye beleve on him who he hath sent.
043	JOH	006	030	They sayde vnto him: what signe shewest thou then that we maye se and beleve the?  What doest thou worke?
043	JOH	006	031	Oure fathers dyd eate Manna in the desert as yt is writte: He gave them breed fro heaven to eate.
043	JOH	006	032	Iesus sayde vnto the: verely verely I saye vnto you: Moses gave you breed fro heave: but my father geveth you the true breed fro heave.
043	JOH	006	033	For the breed of God is he which cometh doune from heave and geveth lyfe vnto the worlde.
043	JOH	006	034	Then sayde they vnto him: Lorde ever moore geve vs this breed.
043	JOH	006	035	And Iesus sayde vnto them: I am that breed of life.  He that cometh to me shall not honger: and he that beleveth on me shall never thurst.
043	JOH	006	036	But I sayed vnto you: that ye have sene me aud yet beleve not.
043	JOH	006	037	All that the father geveth me shall come to me: and him yt cometh to me I cast not awaye.
043	JOH	006	038	For I came doune fro heaven: not to do myne awne will but his will which hath sent me.
043	JOH	006	039	And this is the fathers will which hath sent me that of all which he hath geven me I shuld loose no thinge: but shuld rayse it vp agayne at the last daye.
043	JOH	006	040	And this is the wyll of him yt sent me: yt every man which seith ye sonne and beleveth on him have everlastinge lyfe.  And I will rayse him vp at ye last daye.
043	JOH	006	041	The Iewes then murmured at him because he sayde: I am that breed which is come doune from heaven.
043	JOH	006	042	And they sayde: Is not this Iesus ye sonne of Ioseph whose father and mother we knowe?  How ys yt then that he sayeth I came doune from heave?
043	JOH	006	043	Iesus answered and sayde vnto them.  Murmur not betwene youre selves.
043	JOH	006	044	No man can come to me except the father which hath sent me drawe him.  And I will rayse him vp at the last daye.
043	JOH	006	045	It is written in the Prophetes yt they shall all be taught of God.  Every man therfore that hath hearde and hath learned of the father commeth vnto me.
043	JOH	006	046	Not that eny man hath sene ye father save he which is of God: the same hath sene the father.
043	JOH	006	047	Verely verely I saye vnto you he that beleveth on me hath everlastinge lyfe.
043	JOH	006	048	I am that breed of lyfe.
043	JOH	006	049	Youre fathers dyd eate Mana in ye wildernes and are deed.
043	JOH	006	050	This is that breed which cometh fro heave yt he which eateth of it shuld also not dye.
043	JOH	006	051	I am that lyvinge breed which came doune from heave.  Yf eny man eate of this breed he shall live forever.  And the breed that I will geve is my flesshe which I will geve for the lyfe of ye worlde
043	JOH	006	052	And the Iewes strove amoge them selves sayinge: How can this felowe geve vs his flesshe to eate?
043	JOH	006	053	Then Iesus sayde vnto them: Verely verely I saye vnto you except ye eate ye flesshe of ye sonne of man and drinke his bloude ye shall not have lyfe in you
043	JOH	006	054	Whosoever eateth my flesshe and drinketh my bloude hath eternall lyfe: and I will rayse him vp at the last daye.
043	JOH	006	055	For my flesshe is meate in dede: and my bloude is drynke in dede.
043	JOH	006	056	He that eateth my flesshe and drynketh my bloude dwelleth in me and I in him.
043	JOH	006	057	As the lyvinge father hath sent me even so lyve I by my father: and he that eateth me shall live by me.
043	JOH	006	058	This is the breed which cam from heave: not as youre fathers have eaten Manna and are deed.  He that eateth of this breed shall live ever.
043	JOH	006	059	These thinges sayd he in the synagoge as he taught in Capernaum.
043	JOH	006	060	Many of his disciples when they had herde this sayde: this is an herde sayinge: who can abyde the hearinge of it?
043	JOH	006	061	Iesus knew in him selfe that his disciples murmured at it and sayde vnto them: Doth this offende you?
043	JOH	006	062	What and yf ye shall se the sonne of man ascede vp where he was before?
043	JOH	006	063	It is the sprete that quyckeneth the flesshe proffeteth nothinge.  The wordes that I speake vnto you are sprete and lyfe.
043	JOH	006	064	But ther are some of you that beleve not.  For Iesus knewe from the begynnynge which they were that beleved not and who shuld betraye him.
043	JOH	006	065	And he sayde: Therfore sayde I vnto you: that no man can come vnto me except it were geven vnto him of my father.
043	JOH	006	066	From that tyme many of his disciples wet backe and walked no moore with him.
043	JOH	006	067	Then sayde Iesus to the twelve: will ye alsoo goo awaye?
043	JOH	006	068	Then Simon Peter answered: Master to whom shall we goo?  Thou haste the wordes of eternall lyfe
043	JOH	006	069	and we beleve and knowe yt thou arte Christ the sonne of the lyvinge God.
043	JOH	006	070	Iesus answered them: Have not I chosen you twelve and yet one of you is the devyll?
043	JOH	006	071	He spake it of Iudas Iscariot the sonne of Simon.  For he it was yt shuld betraye him and was one of the twelve.
043	JOH	007	001	After that Iesus wet about in Galile and wolde not go about in Iewry for the Iewes sought to kill him.
043	JOH	007	002	The Iewes tabernacle feast was at honde.
043	JOH	007	003	His brethren therfore sayde vnto him: get ye hence and go into Iewry yt thy disciples maye se thy workes yt thou doest.
043	JOH	007	004	For ther is no man yt doeth eny thing secretly and he him selfe seketh to be knowen.  Yf thou do soche thinges shewe thy selfe to the worlde.
043	JOH	007	005	For as yet his brethre beleved not in him.
043	JOH	007	006	Then Iesus sayd vnto them: My tyme is not yet come youre tyme is all waye redy.
043	JOH	007	007	The worlde canot hate you.  Me it hateth: because I testify of it that the workes of it are evyll.
043	JOH	007	008	Go ye vp vnto this feast.  I will not go vp yet vnto this feast for my tyme is not yet full come.
043	JOH	007	009	These wordes he sayde vnto them and abode still in Galile.
043	JOH	007	010	But assone as his brethren were goone vp then went he also vp vnto the feast: not openly but as it were prevely.
043	JOH	007	011	Then sought him the Iewes at ye feast and sayde: Where is he?
043	JOH	007	012	And moche murmurynge was ther of him amonge the people.  Some sayde: He is good.  Wother sayde naye but he deceaveth the people.
043	JOH	007	013	How be it no ma spake openly of him for feare of the Iewes
043	JOH	007	014	In ye middes of the feast Iesus went vp into the temple and taught.
043	JOH	007	015	And the Iewes marveylled sayinge: How knoweth he ye scriptures seynge yt he never learned?
043	JOH	007	016	Iesus answered them and sayde: My doctrine is not myne: but his that sent me.
043	JOH	007	017	If eny man will do his will he shall knowe of the doctrine whether it be of God or whether I speake of my selfe.
043	JOH	007	018	He that speaketh of him selfe seketh his awne prayse.  But he that seketh his prayse that sent him the same is true and no vnrightewesnes is in him.
043	JOH	007	019	Dyd not Moses geve you a lawe and yet none of you kepeth ye lawe?  Why goo ye aboute to kyll me?
043	JOH	007	020	The people answered and sayde: thou hast the devyll: who goeth aboute to kyll the?
043	JOH	007	021	Iesus answered and sayde to them: I have done one worke and ye all marvayle.
043	JOH	007	022	Moses therfore gave vnto you circumcision: not because it is of Moses but of the fathers.  And yet ye on the Saboth daye circumcise a man.
043	JOH	007	023	If a man on the Saboth daye receave circumcision without breakinge of the lawe of Moses: disdayne ye at me because I have made a man every whit whoale on the saboth daye?
043	JOH	007	024	Iudge not after the vtter aperaunce: but iudge rightewes iudgement.
043	JOH	007	025	Then sayd some of them of Ierusalem: Is not this he who they goo aboute to kyll?
043	JOH	007	026	Beholde he speaketh boldly and they saye nothinge to him.  Do the rulars knowe in dede that this is very Christ?
043	JOH	007	027	How be it we knowe this man whence he is: but when Christ cometh no man shall knowe whence he is.
043	JOH	007	028	Then cryed Iesus in ye temple as he taught sayinge: ye knowe me and whence I am ye knowe.  And yet I am not come of my selfe but he yt sent me is true whom ye knowe not.
043	JOH	007	029	I knowe him: for I am of him and he hath sent me.
043	JOH	007	030	Then they sought to take him: but no ma layde hondes on him because his tyme was not yet come.
043	JOH	007	031	Many of the people beleved on him and sayde: when Christ cometh will he do moo miracles then this man hath done?
043	JOH	007	032	The pharises hearde that the people murmured suche thinges about him.  Wherfore ye pharises and hye prestes sent ministres forthe to take him.
043	JOH	007	033	Then sayde Iesus vnto the: Yet am I a lytell whyle with you and then goo I vnto him that sent me.
043	JOH	007	034	Ye shall seke me and shall not fynde me: and where I am thyther can ye not come.
043	JOH	007	035	Then sayde the Iewes bitwene the selves: whyther will he goo that we shall not fynde him?  Will he goo amonge the gentyls which are scattered all a broade and teache the gentyls?
043	JOH	007	036	What maner of sayinge is this that he sayde: ye shall seke me and shall not fynde me: and where I am thyther can ye not come?
043	JOH	007	037	In the last daye that great daye of the feaste Iesus stode and cryed sayinge: If eny man thyrst let him come vnto me and drinke.
043	JOH	007	038	He that beleveth on me as sayeth the scripture out of his belly shall flowe ryvers of water of lyfe.
043	JOH	007	039	This spak he of the sprete which they that beleved on him shuld receave.  For the holy goost was not yet there because that Iesus was not yet glorifyed.
043	JOH	007	040	Many of the people when they hearde this sayinge sayd: of a truth this is a prophet
043	JOH	007	041	Other sayde: this is Christ.  Some sayde: shall Christ come out of Galile?
043	JOH	007	042	Sayeth not the scripture that Christ shall come of the seed of David: and out of the toune of Bethleem where David was?
043	JOH	007	043	So was ther dissencion amonge the people aboute him.
043	JOH	007	044	And some of them wolde have taken him: but no man layed hondes on him.
043	JOH	007	045	Then came ye ministres to ye hye prestes and pharises.  And they sayde vnto the: why have ye not brought him?
043	JOH	007	046	The servautes answered never man spake as this man doeth.
043	JOH	007	047	Then answered the the pharises: are ye also disceaved?
043	JOH	007	048	Doth eny of the rulers or of the pharises beleve on him?
043	JOH	007	049	But the comen people whiche knowe not ye lawe are cursed.
043	JOH	007	050	Nicodemus sayde vnto them: He that came to Iesus by nyght and was one of them.
043	JOH	007	051	Doth oure lawe iudge eny man before it heare him and knowe what he hath done?
043	JOH	007	052	They answered and sayde vnto him: arte thou also of Galile?  Searche and loke for out of Galile aryseth no Prophet.
043	JOH	007	053	And every man went vnto his awne housse.
043	JOH	008	001	And Iesus went vnto mounte Olivete
043	JOH	008	002	and erly in ye mornynge came agayne into ye temple and all the people came vnto him and he sate doune and taught them.
043	JOH	008	003	And the scribes and ye pharises brought vnto him a woman taken in advoutry and set hyr in the myddes
043	JOH	008	004	and sayde vnto him: Master this woman was taken in advoutry even as the dede was a doyng.
043	JOH	008	005	Moses in the lawe comaunded vs yt suche shuld be stoned.  What sayest thou therfore?
043	JOH	008	006	And this they sayde to tempt him: that they myght have wherof to accuse him.  Iesus stouped doune and with his fynger wrote on the grounde.
043	JOH	008	007	And whyll they continued axynge him he lyfte him selfe vp and sayde vnto them: let him yt is amoge you wt out synne cast the fyrst stone at her.
043	JOH	008	008	And agayne he stouped doune and wrote on ye grounde.
043	JOH	008	009	And assone as they hearde that they went out one by one the eldest fyrst.  And Iesus was lefte a lone and the woman stondynge in ye myddes.
043	JOH	008	010	When Iesus had lyfte vp him selfe agayne and sawe no man but the woman he sayde vnto hyr.  Woman where are those thyne accusars?  Hath no man condempned the?
043	JOH	008	011	She sayde: No man Lorde.  And Iesus sayde: Nether do I condempne the.  Goo and synne no moare.
043	JOH	008	012	Then spake Iesus agayne vnto them sayinge: I am the light of the worlde.  He that foloweth me shall not walke in darcknes: but shall have the light of lyfe.
043	JOH	008	013	The pharises sayde vnto him: thou bearest recorde of thy sylfe thy recorde is not true.
043	JOH	008	014	Iesus answered and sayde vnto them: Though I beare recorde of my selfe yet my recorde is true: for I knowe whece I came and whyther I goo.  But ye cannot tell whece I come and whyther I goo.
043	JOH	008	015	Ye iudge after ye flesshe.  I iudge no man
043	JOH	008	016	though I iudge yet is my iudgmet true.  For I am not alone: but I and the father that sent me.
043	JOH	008	017	It is also written in youre lawe that the testimony of two men is true.
043	JOH	008	018	I am one yt beare witnes of my selfe and the father that sent me beareth witnes of me.
043	JOH	008	019	Then sayde they vnto him: where is thy father?  Iesus answered: ye nether knowe me nor yet my father.  Yf ye had knowen me ye shuld have knowen my father also.
043	JOH	008	020	These wordes spake Iesus in the tresury as he taught in the temple and no man layde hondes on him for his tyme was not yet come.
043	JOH	008	021	Then sayde Iesus agayne vnto them.  I goo my waye and ye shall seke me and shall dye in youre synnes.  Whyther I goo thyther can ye not come.
043	JOH	008	022	Then sayde the Iewes: will he kyll him selfe because he sayth: whyther I goo thyther can ye not come?
043	JOH	008	023	And he sayde vnto the: ye are fro beneth I am from above.  Ye are of this worlde I am not of this worlde.
043	JOH	008	024	I sayde therfore vnto you that ye shall dye in youre synnes.  For except ye beleve that I am he ye shall dye in youre synnes.
043	JOH	008	025	Then sayde they vnto him who arte thou?  And Iesus sayde vnto them: Even ye very same thinge yt I saye vnto you.
043	JOH	008	026	I have many thinges to saye and to iudge of you.  But he yt sent me is true.  And I speake in ye worlde those thinges which I have hearde of him.
043	JOH	008	027	They understode not that he spake of his father.
043	JOH	008	028	Then sayde Iesus vnto them: when ye have lyft vp an hye the sonne of man then shall ye knowe that I am he and that I do nothinge of my selfe: but as my father hath taught me even so I speake:
043	JOH	008	029	and he that sent me is with me.  The father hath not lefte me alone for I do alwayes those thinges that please him.
043	JOH	008	030	As he spake these wordes many beleved on him.
043	JOH	008	031	Then sayde Iesus to those Iewes which beleved on him.  If ye cotinue in my wordes then are ye my very disciples
043	JOH	008	032	and shall knowe the trueth: and the trueth shall make you free.
043	JOH	008	033	They answered him: We be Abrahams seede and were never bonde to eny man: why sayest thou then ye shalbe made fre.
043	JOH	008	034	Iesus answered them: verely verely I saye vnto you that whosoever committeth synne is the servaunt of synne.
043	JOH	008	035	And the servaunt abydeth not in the housse for ever: But ye sonne abydeth ever.
043	JOH	008	036	If the sonne therfore shall make you fre then are ye fre in dede.
043	JOH	008	037	I knowe that ye are Abrahams seed: But ye seke meanes to kyll me because my sayinges have no place in you.
043	JOH	008	038	I speake that I have sene with my father: and ye do that which ye have sene with youre father.
043	JOH	008	039	They answered and sayde vnto him: Abraham is oure father.  Iesus sayde vnto them.  If ye were Abrahams chyldren ye wolde do the dedes of Abraham.
043	JOH	008	040	But now ye goo about io kyll me a man that have tolde you the truthe which I have herde of god: this dyd not Abraham.
043	JOH	008	041	Ye do the dedes of youre father.  Then sayde they vnto him: we were not borne of fornicacion.  We have one father which is God.
043	JOH	008	042	Iesus sayde vnto them: yf God were youre father then wolde ye love me.  For I proceaded forthe and come from God.  Nether came I of my selfe but he sent me.
043	JOH	008	043	Why do ye not knowe my speache?  Even because ye cannot abyde the hearynge of my wordes.
043	JOH	008	044	Ye are of youre father the devyll and the lustes of youre father ye will folowe.  He was a murtherer from the beginnynge and aboode not in the trueth because ther is no trueth in him.  When he speaketh a lye then speaketh he of his awne.  For he is a lyar and the father therof.
043	JOH	008	045	And because I tell you ye trueth therfore ye beleve me not.
043	JOH	008	046	Which of you can rebuke me of synne?  If I saye ye trueth why do not ye beleve me?
043	JOH	008	047	He that is of God heareth goddes wordes Ye therfore heare them not because ye are not of God.
043	JOH	008	048	Then answered the Iewes and sayde vnto him: Saye we not well that thou arte a Samaritane and hast the devyll?
043	JOH	008	049	Iesus answered: I have not the devyll: but I honour my father and ye have dishonoured me.
043	JOH	008	050	I seke not myne awne prayse: but ther is one that seketh and iudgeth.
043	JOH	008	051	Verely verely I saye vnto you yf a man kepe my sayinges he shall never se deeth.
043	JOH	008	052	Then sayde the Iewes to him: Now knowe we that thou hast the devyll.  Abraha is deed and also the Prophetes: and yet thou sayest yf a man kepe my sayinge he shall never tast of deeth.
043	JOH	008	053	Arte thou greater then oure father Abraham which is deed?  and the Prophetes are deed.  Whome makest thou thy selfe?
043	JOH	008	054	Iesus answered: Yf I honoure my selfe myne honoure is nothinge worth.  It is my father that honoureth me which ye saye is youre God
043	JOH	008	055	and ye have not knowen him: but I knowe him.  And yf I shuld saye I knowe him not I shuld be a lyar lyke vnto you.  But I knowe him and kepe his sayinge.
043	JOH	008	056	Youre father Abraham was glad to se my daye and he sawe it and reioysed.
043	JOH	008	057	Then sayde the Iewes vnto him: thou arte not yet. l.  yere olde and hast thou sene Abraham?
043	JOH	008	058	Iesus sayd vnto them: Verely verely I saye vnto you: yer Abraham was I am.
043	JOH	008	059	Then toke they vp stones to caste at him.  But Iesus hid him selfe and went out of ye temple.
043	JOH	009	001	And as Iesus passed by he sawe a man which was blynde from his birth.
043	JOH	009	002	And his disciples axed him sayinge.  Master who dyd synne: this man or his father and mother that he was borne blynde?
043	JOH	009	003	Iesus answered: Nether hath this man synned nor yet his father and mother: but that the workes of God shuld be shewed on him.
043	JOH	009	004	I must worke the workes of him that sent me whyll it is daye.  The nyght cometh when no man can worke.
043	JOH	009	005	As longe as I am in the worlde I am the lyght of the worlde.
043	JOH	009	006	Assone as he had thus spoken he spate on the grounde and made claye of the spetle and rubbed the claye on the eyes of the blynde
043	JOH	009	007	and sayde vnto him: Goo wesshe the in ye pole of Syloe which by interpretacion signifieth sent.  He went his waye and wasshed and cam agayne seinge.
043	JOH	009	008	The neghboures and they that had sene him before how that he was a begger sayde: is not this he that sate and begged?
043	JOH	009	009	Some sayde: this is he.  Other sayd: he is lyke him.  But he him selfe sayde: I am even he.
043	JOH	009	010	They sayde vnto him: How are thyne eyes opened then?
043	JOH	009	011	He answered and sayde.  The ma that is called Iesus made claye and anoynted myne eyes and sayd vnto me: Goo to the pole Syloe and wesshe.  I went and wesshed and receaved my syght.
043	JOH	009	012	They sayde vnto him: where is he?  He sayde: I cannot tell.
043	JOH	009	013	Then brought they to ye pharises him that a lytell before was blynde:
043	JOH	009	014	for it was the Saboth daye when Iesus made the claye and opened his eyes.
043	JOH	009	015	Then agayne the pharises also axed him how he had receaved his syght.  He sayde vnto the: He put claye apon myne eyes and I wasshed and do se.
043	JOH	009	016	Then sayde some of the pharises: this man is not of God because he kepeth not the saboth daye.  Other sayde: how can a man yt is a synner do suche myracles?  And ther was stryfe amonge the.
043	JOH	009	017	Then spake they vnto the blynde agayne: What sayst thou of him because he hath openned thyne eyes?  And he sayd: He is a Prophet.
043	JOH	009	018	But the Iewes dyd not beleve of the felowe how that he was blynde and receaved his syght vntyll they had called the father and mother of him that had receaved his syght.
043	JOH	009	019	And they axed the saying: Is this youre sonne whome ye saye was borne blynde?  How doth he now se then?
043	JOH	009	020	His father and mother answered them and sayde: we wote well that this is oure sonne and that he was borne blynde:
043	JOH	009	021	but by what meanes he now seith that can we not tell or who hath opened his eyes can we not tell.  He is olde ynough axe him let him answer for him selfe.
043	JOH	009	022	Suche wordes spake his father and mother because they feared the Iewes.  For the Iewes had conspyred all redy that yf eny man dyd confesse that he was Christ he shuld be excommunicat out of the synagoge.
043	JOH	009	023	Therefore sayde his father and mother: he is olde ynough axe him.
043	JOH	009	024	Then agayne called they the man that was blynde and sayd vnto him: Geve God the prayse: we knowe that this man is a synner.
043	JOH	009	025	He answered and sayde: Whyther he be a synner or noo I cannot tell: One thinge I am sure of that I was blynde and now I se.
043	JOH	009	026	Then sayde they to him agayne.  What dyd he to the?  How opened he thyne eyes?
043	JOH	009	027	He answered them I tolde you yerwhyle and ye dyd not heare.  Wherfore wolde ye heare it agayne?  Will ye also be his disciples?
043	JOH	009	028	Then rated they him and sayde: Thou arte his disciple.  We be Moses disciples.
043	JOH	009	029	We are sure that God spake with Moses.  This felowe we knowe not from whence he is.
043	JOH	009	030	The man answered and sayde vnto them: this is a merveleous thinge that ye wote not whence he is seinge he hath opened myne eyes.
043	JOH	009	031	For we be sure that God heareth not synners.  But yf eny man be a worshipper of God and do his will him heareth he.
043	JOH	009	032	Sence ye worlde beganne was it not hearde yt eny man opened the eyes of one that was borne blynd.
043	JOH	009	033	If this man were not of God he coulde have done no thinge.
043	JOH	009	034	They answered and sayd vnto him: thou arte altogeder borne in synne: and dost thou teache vs?  And they cast him out.
043	JOH	009	035	Iesus hearde that they had excommunicate him: and assone as he had founde him he sayd vnto him: doest thou beleve on the sonne of God?
043	JOH	009	036	He answered and sayde: Who is it Lorde that I myght beleve on him?
043	JOH	009	037	And Iesus sayde vnto him: Thou hast sene him and he it is that talketh with the.
043	JOH	009	038	And he sayde: Lorde I beleve: and worshipped him.
043	JOH	009	039	Iesus sayde: I am come vnto iudgement into this worlde: that they which se not myght se and they which se myght be made blynde.
043	JOH	009	040	And some of the pharises which were with him hearde these wordes and sayde vnto him: are we then blynde?
043	JOH	009	041	Iesus sayde vnto them: yf ye were blynde ye shuld have no synne.  But now ye saye we se therfore youre synne remayneth.
043	JOH	010	001	Verely verely I saye vnto you: he that entreth not in by ye dore into the shepefolde but clymeth vp some other waye: the same is a thefe and a robber.
043	JOH	010	002	He that goeth in by ye dore is the shepeherde of ye shepe:
043	JOH	010	003	to him the porter openeth and the shepe heare his voyce and he calleth his awne shepe by name and leadeth them out.
043	JOH	010	004	And when he hath sent forthe his awne shepe he goeth before them and the shepe folowe him: for they knowe his voyce.
043	JOH	010	005	A straunger they will not folowe but will flye from him: for they knowe not the voyce of straungers.
043	JOH	010	006	This similitude spake Iesus vnto them.  But they vnderstode not what thinges they were which he spake vnto them.
043	JOH	010	007	Then sayde Iesus vnto them agayne.  Verely verely I saye vnto you: I am the dore of the shepe.
043	JOH	010	008	All even as many as came before me are theves and robbers: but the shepe dyd not heare them.
043	JOH	010	009	I am the dore: by me yf eny man enter in he shalbe safe and shall goo in and out and fynde pasture.
043	JOH	010	010	The thefe cometh not but forto steale kyll and destroye.  I am come that they myght have lyfe and have it more aboundantly.
043	JOH	010	011	I am ye good shepeheerd.  The good shepeheerd geveth his lyfe for ye shepe.
043	JOH	010	012	An heyred servaut which is not ye shepeherd nether ye shepe are his awne seith the wolfe comynge and leveth the shepe and flyeth and the wolfe catcheth them and scattereth ye shepe.
043	JOH	010	013	The heyred servaut flyeth because he is an heyred servaunt and careth not for the shepe.
043	JOH	010	014	I am that good shepeheerd and knowe myne and am knowe of myne.
043	JOH	010	015	As my father knoweth me: even so knowe I my father.  And I geve my lyfe for the shepe:
043	JOH	010	016	and other shepe I have which are not of this folde.  Them also must I bringe that they maye heare my voyce and that ther maye be one flocke and one shepeherde.
043	JOH	010	017	Therfore doth my father love me because I put my lyfe from me that I myght take it agayne.
043	JOH	010	018	No man taketh it from me: but I put it awaye of my selfe.  I have power to put it from me and have power to take it agayne: This comaundment have I receaved of my father.
043	JOH	010	019	And ther was a dissencion agayne amoge the Iewes for these sayinges
043	JOH	010	020	and many of them sayd.  He hath the devyll and is mad: why heare ye him?
043	JOH	010	021	Other sayde these are not the wordes of him that hath the devyll.  Can the devyll open the eyes of the blynde?
043	JOH	010	022	And it was at Ierusalem ye feaste of the dedicacion and it was wynter:
043	JOH	010	023	and Iesus walked in Salomons porche.
043	JOH	010	024	Then came the Iewes rounde aboute him and sayde vnto him: How longe dost thou make vs doute?  Yf thou be Christ tell vs playnly.
043	JOH	010	025	Iesus answered them: I tolde you and ye beleve not.  The workes yt I do in my fathers name they beare witnes of me.
043	JOH	010	026	But ye beleve not because ye are not of my shepe.  As I sayde vnto you:
043	JOH	010	027	my shepe heare my voyce and I knowe them and they folowe me
043	JOH	010	028	and I geve vnto the eternall lyfe and they shall never perisshe nether shall eny man plucke the oute of my honde.
043	JOH	010	029	My father which gave the me is greatter then all and no man is able to take them out of my fathers honde.
043	JOH	010	030	And I and my father are one.
043	JOH	010	031	Then the Iewes agayne toke up stones to stone him with all.
043	JOH	010	032	Iesus answered them: many good workes have I shewed you from my father: for which of them will ye stone me?
043	JOH	010	033	The Iewes answered him sayinge.  For thy good workes sake we stone ye not: but for thy blasphemy and because that thou beinge a man makest thy selfe God.
043	JOH	010	034	Iesus answered them: Is it not written in youre lawe: I saye ye are goddes?
043	JOH	010	035	If he called the goddes vnto whom the worde of God was spoken (and the scripture can not be broken)
043	JOH	010	036	saye ye then to him whom the father hath sainctified and sent into the worlde thou blasphemest because I sayd I am the sonne of God?
043	JOH	010	037	If I do not the workes of my father beleve me not.
043	JOH	010	038	But if I do though ye beleve not me yet beleve the workes that ye maye knowe and beleve that the father is in me and I in him.
043	JOH	010	039	Agayne they went aboute to take him: but he escaped out of their hondes
043	JOH	010	040	and went awaye agayne beyonde Iordan into the place where Iohn before had baptised and there aboode.
043	JOH	010	041	And many resorted vnto him and sayd.  Iohn dyd no miracle: but all thinges that Iohn spake of this man are true.
043	JOH	010	042	And many beleved on him theare.
043	JOH	011	001	A certayne man was sicke named Lazarus of Bethania the toune of Mary and her sister Martha.
043	JOH	011	002	It was that Mary which annoynted Iesus with oyntment and wyped his fete with her heere whose brother Lazarus was sicke
043	JOH	011	003	and his sisters sent vnto him sayinge.  Lorde behold he whom thou lovest is sicke.
043	JOH	011	004	When Iesus hearde yt he sayd: this infirmite is not vnto deth but for ye laude of God that the sonne of God myght be praysed by the reason of it.
043	JOH	011	005	Iesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.
043	JOH	011	006	After he hearde that he was sicke then aboode he two dayes still in the same place where he was.
043	JOH	011	007	Then after that sayd he to his disciples: let us goo into Iewry agayne.
043	JOH	011	008	His disciples sayde vnto him.  Master the Iewes lately sought meanes to stone the and wilt thou goo thyther agayne?
043	JOH	011	009	Iesus answered: are ther not twelve houres in ye daye?  Yf a man walke in ye daye he stombleth not because he seith the lyght of this worlde.
043	JOH	011	010	But yf a ma walke in ye nyght he stombleth because ther is no lyght in him.
043	JOH	011	011	This sayde he and after yt he sayde vnto the: oure frende Lazarus slepeth but I goo to wake him out of slepe.
043	JOH	011	012	Then sayde his disciples: Lorde yf he slepe he shall do well ynough.
043	JOH	011	013	How be it Iesus spake of his deeth: but they thought yt he had spoke of ye naturall slepe.
043	JOH	011	014	Then sayde Iesus vnto the playnly Lazarus is deed
043	JOH	011	015	and I am glad for youre sakes yt I was not there because ye maye beleve.  Neverthelesse let vs go vnto him.
043	JOH	011	016	Then sayde Thomas which is called Dydimus vnto ye disciples: let vs also goo that we maye dye wt him
043	JOH	011	017	Then went Iesus and founde that he had lyne in his grave foure dayes already.
043	JOH	011	018	Bethanie was nye vnto Ierusalem aboute.  xv.  furlonges of
043	JOH	011	019	and many of the Iewes were come to Martha and Mary to comforte them over their brother.
043	JOH	011	020	Martha assone as she hearde yt Iesus was comynge went and met him: but Mary sate still in the housse.
043	JOH	011	021	Then sayde Martha vnto Iesus: Lorde yf thou haddest bene here my brother had not bene deed:
043	JOH	011	022	but neverthelesse I knowe that whatsoever thou axest of God God will geve it the.
043	JOH	011	023	Iesus sayde vnto her: Thy brother shall ryse agayne.
043	JOH	011	024	Martha sayde vnto him: I knowe that he shall ryse agayne in the resurreccion at the last daye.
043	JOH	011	025	Iesus sayde vnto her: I am the resurreccion and the lyfe: He that beleveth on me ye though he were deed yet shall he lyve.
043	JOH	011	026	And whosoever lyveth and belevest on me shall never dye.  Beleveth thou this?
043	JOH	011	027	She sayde vnto him: ye Lorde I beleve that thou arte Christ the sonne of god which shuld come into the worlde.
043	JOH	011	028	And assone as she had so sayde she went her waye and called Marie her sister secretly sayinge: The master is come and calleth for the
043	JOH	011	029	And she assone as she hearde that arose quickly and came vnto him.
043	JOH	011	030	Iesus was not yet come into the toune: but was in the place where Martha met him.
043	JOH	011	031	The Iewes then which were with her in the housse and comforted her when they sawe Mary that she rose vp hastely and went out folowed her saying: She goeth vnto the grave to wepe there.
043	JOH	011	032	Then when Mary was come where Iesus was and sawe him she fell doune at his fete sayinge vnto him: Lorde yf thou haddest bene here my brother had not bene deed.
043	JOH	011	033	When Iesus sawe her wepe and ye Iewes also wepe which came wt her he groned in ye sprete and was troubled in him selfe
043	JOH	011	034	and sayde: Where have ye layed him?  They sayde vnto him: Lorde come and se.
043	JOH	011	035	And Iesus wept.
043	JOH	011	036	Then sayde the Iewes: Beholde howe he loved him.
043	JOH	011	037	And some of the sayde: coulde not he which openned the eyes of the blynde have made also that this man shuld not have dyed?
043	JOH	011	038	Iesus agayne groned in him selfe and came to the grave.  It was a caue and a stone layde on it.
043	JOH	011	039	And Iesus sayd: take ye awaye the stone.  Martha the sister of him that was deed sayd vnto him: Lorde by this tyme he stinketh.  For he hath bene deed foure dayes:
043	JOH	011	040	Iesus sayde vnto her: Sayde I not vnto the yt if thou didest beleve thou shuldest se ye glory of God.
043	JOH	011	041	Then they toke awaye ye stone from ye place where the deed was layde.  And Iesus lyfte vp his eyes and sayde: Father I thanke the because that thou hast hearde me.
043	JOH	011	042	I wot that thou hearest me all wayes: but because of the people that stonde by I sayde it yt they maye beleve that thou hast sent me.
043	JOH	011	043	And when he thus had spoken he cryed wt a loud voyce.  Lazarus come forthe.
043	JOH	011	044	And he that was deed came forth bounde hand and fote with grave bondes and his face was bounde with a napkin.  Iesus sayde vnto the: loowse him and let him goo.
043	JOH	011	045	Then many of the Iewes which came to Mary and had sene the thinges which Iesus dyd beleved on him.
043	JOH	011	046	But some of them went their wayes to the Pharises and tolde them what Iesus had done.
043	JOH	011	047	Then gadered the hye prestes and the Pharises a counsell and sayde: what do we?  This ma doeth many miracles.
043	JOH	011	048	Yf we let him scape thus all men will beleve on him and ye Romaynes shall come and take awaye oure countre and the people.
043	JOH	011	049	And one of them named Cayphas which was the hieprest yt same yeare sayde vnto them: Ye perceave nothinge at all
043	JOH	011	050	nor yet consider that it is expedient for vs that one man dye for the people and not that all the people perisshe.
043	JOH	011	051	This spake he not of him selfe but beinge hye preste that same yeare he prophesied that Iesus shulde dye for the people
043	JOH	011	052	and not for the people only but that he shuld gader to geder in one the chyldren of God which were scattered abroode.
043	JOH	011	053	From that daye forth they held a counsell to geder for to put him to deeth.
043	JOH	011	054	Iesus therfore walked no more opely amoge the Iewes: but wet his waye thence vnto a coutre nye to a wildernes into a cite called Ephraim and there hauted with his disciples.
043	JOH	011	055	And the Iewes ester was nye at hand and many went out of the countre vp to Ierusalem before the ester to purify them selves.
043	JOH	011	056	Then sought they for Iesus and spake bitwene the selves as they stode in the teple: What thinke ye seynge he cometh not to the feast.
043	JOH	011	057	The hye prestes and Pharises had geven a comaundemet that yf eny man knew where he were he shuld shewe it that they myght take him.
043	JOH	012	001	Then Iesus sixe dayes before ester came to Bethany where Lazarus was which was deed and who Iesus raysed from deeth.
043	JOH	012	002	There they made him a supper and Martha served: But Lazarus was one of them that sate at the table with him.
043	JOH	012	003	Then toke Mary a pounde of oyntmet called Nardus perfecte and precious and anoynted Iesus fete and wipt his fete with her heer and the housse was filled of the savre of the oyntmet.
043	JOH	012	004	Then sayde one of his disciples name Iudas Iscariot Simos sonne which afterwarde betrayed him:
043	JOH	012	005	why was not this oyntmet solde for thre hondred pence and geve to the poore?
043	JOH	012	006	This sayde he not that he cared for the pooer: but because he was a thefe and kept the bagge and bare that which was geven.
043	JOH	012	007	Then sayde Iesus: Let her alone agaynst the daye of my buryinge she kept it.
043	JOH	012	008	The poore all wayes shall ye have with you but me shall ye not all wayes have.
043	JOH	012	009	Moche people of the Iewes had knowledge that he was there.  And they came not for Iesus sake only but yt they myght se Lazarus also whom he raysed from deeth.
043	JOH	012	010	The hye prestes therfore held a counsell that they myght put Lazarus to deeth also
043	JOH	012	011	because that for his sake many of the Iewes went awaye and beleved on Iesus.
043	JOH	012	012	On the morowe moche people that were come to the feast when they hearde yt Iesus shuld come to Ierusalem
043	JOH	012	013	toke braunches of palme trees and went and met him and cryed: Hosanna blessed is he that in the name of the Lorde commeth kynge of Israel.
043	JOH	012	014	And Iesus got a yonge asse and sate thero accordinge to that which was writte:
043	JOH	012	015	feare not doughter of Sio beholde thy kynge cometh sittinge on an asses coolte.
043	JOH	012	016	These thinges vnderstode not his disciples at ye fyrst: but when Iesus was gloryfied then remembryd they that soche thinges were written of him and that soche thinges they had done vnto him.
043	JOH	012	017	The people that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave and raysed him from deeth bare recorde.
043	JOH	012	018	Therfore met him the people be cause they hearde yt he had done soche a myracle.
043	JOH	012	019	The Pharises therfore sayde amonge them selves: perceave ye how we prevayle no thinge?  beholde the worlde goth awaye after him.
043	JOH	012	020	Ther were certayne Grekes amoge them that came to praye at the feast:
043	JOH	012	021	the same cam to Philip which was of Bethsayda a cyte in Galile and desired him sayinge: Syr we wolde fayne se Iesus.
043	JOH	012	022	Philip came and tolde Andrew.  And agayne Andrew and Philip tolde Iesus.
043	JOH	012	023	And Iesus answered them sayinge: the houre is come yt the sonne of ma must be glorified.
043	JOH	012	024	Verely verely I saye vnto you except ye wheate corne fall into the grounde and dye it bydeth alone.  Yf it dye it brengeth forth moche frute.
043	JOH	012	025	He that loveth his lyfe shall destroye it: and he yt hateth his lyfe in this worlde shall kepe it vnto lyfe eternall.
043	JOH	012	026	If eny man mynister vnto me let him folowe me and where I am there shall also my minister be.  And yf eny man minister vnto me him will my father honoure.
043	JOH	012	027	Now is my soule troubled and what shall I saye?  Father delyver me from this houre: but therfore came I vnto this houre
043	JOH	012	028	Father glorify thy name.  Then came ther a voyce fro heaven: I have glorified it and will glorify it agayne.
043	JOH	012	029	Then sayd the people yt stode by and hearde: it thoundreth.  Other sayde an angell spake to him.
043	JOH	012	030	Iesus answered and sayde: this voyce cam not because of me but for youre sakes.
043	JOH	012	031	Now is the iudgement of this worlde: now shall ye prince of this worlde be cast out.
043	JOH	012	032	And I yf I were lifte vp from the erthe will drawe all men vnto me.
043	JOH	012	033	This sayde Iesus signifyinge what deeth he shuld dye.
043	JOH	012	034	The people answered him: We have hearde of ye lawe yt Christ bydeth ever: and how sayest thou then that the sonne of man must be lifte vp?  who is yt sonne of ma?
043	JOH	012	035	Then Iesus sayde vnto them: yet a lytell whyle is the light wt you.  Walke whill ye have light lest the darcknes come on you.  He that walketh in the darke wotteth not whither he goeth.
043	JOH	012	036	Whyll ye have light beleve on the light that ye maye be the chyldren of light.  These thinges spake Iesus and departed and hyd him silfe fro them.
043	JOH	012	037	And though he had done so many myracles before them yet beleved not they on him
043	JOH	012	038	yt the sayinge of Esayas the Prophet myght be fulfilled yt he spake.  Lorde who shall beleve oure sayinge?  And to whom ys the arme of ye Lorde opened?
043	JOH	012	039	Therfore coulde they not beleve because yt Esaias sayth agayne:
043	JOH	012	040	he hath blinded their eyes and hardened their hertes that they shuld not se with their eyes and vnderstonde with their hertes and shuld be converted and I shuld heale the.
043	JOH	012	041	Soche thinges sayde Esaias when he sawe his glory and spake of him.
043	JOH	012	042	Neverthelesse amoge ye chefe rulers many beleved on him.  But because of the pharises they wolde not be a knowen of it lest they shuld be excommunicate.
043	JOH	012	043	For they loved the prayse yt is geven of men more then the prayse that cometh of God.
043	JOH	012	044	And Iesus cryed and sayde: he that beleveth on me beleveth not on me but on him yt sent me.
043	JOH	012	045	And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me.
043	JOH	012	046	I am come a light into the worlde that whosoever beleveth on me shuld not byde in darcknes.
043	JOH	012	047	And yf eny man heare my wordes and beleve not I iudge him not.  For I came not to iudge the worlde: but to save ye worlde.
043	JOH	012	048	He that refuseth me and receaveth not my wordes hath one that iudgeth him.  The wordes that I have spoken they shall iudge him in ye last daye.
043	JOH	012	049	For I have not spoken of my selfe: but the father which sent me he gave me a commaundemet what I shuld saye and what I shuld speake.
043	JOH	012	050	And I knowe that this comaundement is lyfe everlastinge.  Whatsoever I speake therfore eve as the father bade me so I speake.
043	JOH	013	001	Before the feast of ester whe Iesus knewe that his houre was come that he shuld departe out of this worlde vnto the father.  When he loved his which were in the worlde vnto the ende he loved the.
043	JOH	013	002	And when supper was ended after that the devyll had put in the hert of Iudas Iscariot Simos sonne to betraye him:
043	JOH	013	003	Iesus knowinge that the father had geve all thinges into his hondes.  And that he was come from God and went to God
043	JOH	013	004	he rose from supper and layde a syde his vpper garmentes and toke a towell and gyrd him selfe.
043	JOH	013	005	After that poured he water into a basyn and beganne to wash his disciples fete and to wype them with the towell wherwith he was gyrde.
043	JOH	013	006	Then came he to Simon Peter.  And Peter sayde to him: Lorde shalt thou wesshe my fete?
043	JOH	013	007	Iesus answered and sayde vnto him: what I do thou wotest not now but thou shalt knowe herafter.
043	JOH	013	008	Peter sayd vnto him: thou shalt not wesshe my fete whill ye worlde stondeth.  Iesus answered him: yf I wasshe ye not thou shalt have no part with me.
043	JOH	013	009	Simon Peter sayde vnto him: Lorde not my fete only: but also my handes and my heed.
043	JOH	013	010	Iesus sayde to him: he that is wesshed nedeth not save to wesshe his fete and is clene every whit.  And ye are clene: but not all.
043	JOH	013	011	For he knewe his betrayer.  Therfore sayde he: ye are not all clene.
043	JOH	013	012	After he had wesshed their fete and receaved his clothes and was set doune agayne he sayde vnto them?  wot ye what I have done to you?
043	JOH	013	013	Ye call me master and Lorde and ye saye well for so am I.
043	JOH	013	014	If I then youre Lorde and master have wesshed youre fete ye also ought to wesshe one anothers fete.
043	JOH	013	015	For I have geven you an ensample that ye shuld do as I have done to you.
043	JOH	013	016	Verely verely I saye vnto you the servaunt is not greater then his master nether the messenger greater then he that sent him.
043	JOH	013	017	If ye vnderstonde these thinges happy are ye yf ye do them.
043	JOH	013	018	I speake not of you all I knowe whom I have chosen.  But that ye scripture be fulfilled: he that eateth breed wt me hath lyfte vp his hele agaynste me.
043	JOH	013	019	Now tell I you before it come: that when it is come to passe ye might beleve that I am he.
043	JOH	013	020	Verely verely I saye vnto you.  He that receaveth who soever I sende receaveth me.  And he that receaveth me receaveth him that sent me.
043	JOH	013	021	When Iesus had thus sayd he was troubled in the sprete and testified sayinge: verely verely I saye vnto you that one of you shall betraye me.
043	JOH	013	022	And then the disciples loked one on another doutinge of who he spake.
043	JOH	013	023	Ther was one of his disciples which leaned on Iesus bosome whom Iesus loved.
043	JOH	013	024	To him beckened Simo Peter that he shuld axe who it was of whom he spake.
043	JOH	013	025	He then as he leaned on Iesus brest sayde vnto him: Lorde who ys it?
043	JOH	013	026	Iesus answered he yt ys to whom I geve a soppe when I have dept it.  And he wet a soppe and gave it to Iudas Iscarioth Simons sonne.
043	JOH	013	027	And after the soppe Satan entred into him.  Then sayd Iesus vnto him: that thou dost do quickly.
043	JOH	013	028	That wist no ma at the table for what intent he spake vnto him.
043	JOH	013	029	Some of the thought because Iudas had the bagge that Iesus had sayd vnto him bye those thinges that we have nede af agaynst ye feast: or that he shulde geve some thinge to the poore.
043	JOH	013	030	Assone then as he had receaved the soppe he wet immediatly out.  And it was night.
043	JOH	013	031	Whe he was gone out Iesus sayde: now is the sonne of man glorified.  And God is glorified by him.
043	JOH	013	032	Yf God be glorified by him God shall also glorify him in him selfe: and shall strayght waye glorify him.
043	JOH	013	033	Deare chyldren yet a lytell whyle am I with you.  Ye shall seke me and as I sayde vnto the Iewes whither I goo thither can ye not come.  Also to you saye I nowe.
043	JOH	013	034	A newe commaundment geve I vnto you that ye love to gedder as I have loved you that even so ye love one another
043	JOH	013	035	By this shall all me knowe yt ye are my disciples yf ye shall have love one to another.
043	JOH	013	036	Simon Peter sayd vnto him: Lorde whither goest thou?  Iesus answered him: whither I goo thou canst not folowe me now but thou shalt folowe me afterwardes.
043	JOH	013	037	Peter sayd vnto him: Lorde why canot I folowe the now?  I will geve my lyfe for thy sake?
043	JOH	013	038	Iesus answered him: wilt thou geve thy lyfe for my sake?  Verely verely I saye vnto the the cocke shall not crowe tyll thou have denyed me thryse.
043	JOH	014	001	And he sayd vnto his disciples: Let not youre hertes be troubled.  Beleve in god and beleve in me.
043	JOH	014	002	In my fathers housse are many mansions.  If it were not so I wolde have tolde you.  I go to prepare a place for you.
043	JOH	014	003	And yf I go to prepare a place for you I will come agayne and receave you eve vnto my selfe yt where I am there maye ye be also.
043	JOH	014	004	And whither I go ye knowe and ye waye ye knowe.
043	JOH	014	005	Thomas sayde vnto him: Lorde we knowe not whyther thou goest.  Also how is it possible for vs to knowe the waye?
043	JOH	014	006	Iesus sayd vnto him: I am ye waye ye truthe and ye life.  And no man cometh vnto the father but by me.
043	JOH	014	007	Yf ye had knowe me ye had knowe my father also.  And now ye knowe him and have sene him.
043	JOH	014	008	Philip sayd vnto him: Lorde shew vs the father and it suffiseth vs.
043	JOH	014	009	Iesus sayde vnto him: have I bene so longe tyme wt you: and yet hast thou not knowen me?  Philip he yt hath sene me hath sene ye father.  And how sayest thou then: shew vs the father?
043	JOH	014	010	Belevest thou not that I am in ye father and the father in me?  The wordes that I speake vnto you I speakee not of my selfe: but ye father that dwelleth in me is he that doeth ye workes.
043	JOH	014	011	Beleve me that I am the father and ye father in me.  At the leest beleve me for the very workes sake.
043	JOH	014	012	Verely verely I saye vnto you: he that beleveth on me the workes that I doo the same shall he do and greater workes then these shall he do because I go vnto my father.
043	JOH	014	013	And what soever ye axe in my name yt will I do yt the father might be glorified by the sonne.
043	JOH	014	014	Yf ye shall axe eny thige in my name I will do it
043	JOH	014	015	If ye love me kepe my comaundementes
043	JOH	014	016	and I will praye the father and he shall geve you a nother comforter yt he maye byde with you ever
043	JOH	014	017	which is the sprete of truthe whome the worlde canot receave because the worlde seyth him not nether knoweth him.  But ye knowe him.  For he dwelleth with you and shalbe in you.
043	JOH	014	018	I will not leave you comfortlesse: but will come vnto you.
043	JOH	014	019	Yet a litell whyle and the worlde seith me no moare: but ye shall se me.  For I live and ye shall live.
043	JOH	014	020	That daye shall ye knowe that I am in my father and you in me and I in you
043	JOH	014	021	He that hath my comaundemetes and kepeth them the same is he that loveth me.  And he yt loveth me shall be loved of my father: and I will love him and will shewe myne awne selfe vnto him.
043	JOH	014	022	Iudas sayde vnto him (not Iudas Iscarioth) Lorde what is the cause that thou wilt shewe thy selfe vnto vs and not vnto the worlde?
043	JOH	014	023	Iesus answered and sayde vnto him: yf a man love me and wyll kepe my sayinges my father also will love him and we will come vnto him and will dwelle with him.
043	JOH	014	024	He that loveth me not kepeth not my sayinges.  And the wordes which ye heare are not myne but the fathers which sent me.
043	JOH	014	025	This have I spoken vnto you beynge yet present with you.
043	JOH	014	026	But that coforter which is the holy gost (whom my father will sende in my name) he shall teache you all thinges and bringe all thinges to youre remembraunce whatsoever I have tolde you.
043	JOH	014	027	Peace I leve with you my peace I geve vnto you.  Not as the worlde geveth geve I vnto you.  Let not youre hertes be greved nether feare ye.
043	JOH	014	028	Ye have hearde how I sayde vnto you: I go and come agayne vnto you.  If ye loved me ye wolde verely reioyce because I sayde I go vnto ye father.  For ye father is greater then I
043	JOH	014	029	And now have I shewed you before it come yt whe it is come to passe ye might beleve.
043	JOH	014	030	Here after will I not talke many mordes vnto you.  For the rular of this worlde commeth and hath nought in me.
043	JOH	014	031	But that the worlde maye knowe that I love the father: therfore as the father gave me comaundment even so do I.  Ryse let vs go hence.
043	JOH	015	001	I am the true vyne and my father ys an husbande man.
043	JOH	015	002	Every braunche that beareth not frute in me he will take awaye.  And every braunche that beareth frute will he pourge yt it maye bringe moare frute.
043	JOH	015	003	Now are ye cleane thorow ye wordes which I have spoke vnto you.
043	JOH	015	004	Byde in me and let me byde in you.  As ye braunche canot beare frute of it sylfe excepte it byde in the vyne: no more can ye excepte ye abyde in me.
043	JOH	015	005	I am the vyne and ye are the braunches.  He that abydeth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth moche frute.  For with out me can ye do nothinge.
043	JOH	015	006	Yf a man byde not in me he ys cast forthe as a braunche and is wyddered: and men gadder it and cast it into the fyre and it burneth.
043	JOH	015	007	Yf ye byde in me and my wordes also byde in you: axe what ye will and it shalbe done to you.
043	JOH	015	008	Heare in is my father glorified that ye beare moche frute and be made my disciples.
043	JOH	015	009	As the father hath loved me eve so have I leved you.  Continue in my love.
043	JOH	015	010	Yf ye shall kepe my comaudemetes ye shall byde in my love eve as I have kept my fathers comaundementes and byde in his love.
043	JOH	015	011	These thinges have I spoken vnto you yt my ioye myght remayne in you and that youre ioye might be full.
043	JOH	015	012	This is my commaundement that ye love togedder as I have loved you.
043	JOH	015	013	Gretter love then this hath no man then that a man bestowe his lyfe for his frendes.
043	JOH	015	014	Ye are my fredes yf ye do whatsoever I commaunde you.
043	JOH	015	015	Hence forth call I you not servauntes: for the servaunt knoweth not what his Lorde doeth.  But you have I called frendes: for all thinges that I have hearde of my father I have opened to you.
043	JOH	015	016	Ye have not chosen me but I have chosen you and ordeyned you that ye go and bringe forthe frute and that youre frute remayne that whatsoever ye shall axe of the father in my name he shulde geve it you.
043	JOH	015	017	This comaunde I you that ye love to gedder.
043	JOH	015	018	Yf ye worlde hate you ye knowe that he hated me before he hated you.
043	JOH	015	019	Yf ye were of the worlde ye worlde wolde love his awne.  How be it because ye are not of ye worlde but I have chosen you out of the worlde therfore hateth you the worlde.
043	JOH	015	020	Remember the sayinge that I sayde vnto you: the servaute is not greater then his lorde.  Yf they have persecuted me so will they persecute you Yf they have kept my sayinge so will they kepe youres.
043	JOH	015	021	But all these thinges will they do vnto you for my names sake because they have not knowen him that sent me.
043	JOH	015	022	If I had not come and spoken vnto them they shulde not have had synne: but now have they nothinge to cloke their synne with all.
043	JOH	015	023	He that hateth me hateth my father.
043	JOH	015	024	If I had not done workes amoge the which none other ma dyd they had not had synne.  But now have they sene and yet have hated bothe me and my father:
043	JOH	015	025	eve that the sayinge myght be fulfilled that is written in theyr lawe: they hated me wtout a cause.
043	JOH	015	026	But when the comforter is come whom I will sende vnto you fro the father which is the sprete of truthe which proceadeth of the father he shall testifie of me.
043	JOH	015	027	And ye shall beare witnes also because ye have bene with me from the begynninge.
043	JOH	016	001	These thinges have I sayde vnto you because ye shuld not be offended.
043	JOH	016	002	They shall excomunicat you: ye ye tyme shall come that whosoever killeth you will thinke that he doth God service.
043	JOH	016	003	And suche thinges will they do vnto you because they have not knowen the father nether yet me.
043	JOH	016	004	But these thinges have I tolde you that when that houre is come ye myght remember them that I tolde you so.  These thinges sayde I not unto you at the begynninge because I was present with you.
043	JOH	016	005	But now I goo my waye to him that sent me and none of you axeth me: whither goest thou?
043	JOH	016	006	But because I have sayde suche thinges vnto you youre hertes are full of sorowe.
043	JOH	016	007	Neverthelesse I tell you the trueth it is expedient for you that I goo awaye.  For yf I goo not awaye that comforter will not come vnto you.  But yf I departe I will sende him vnto you.
043	JOH	016	008	And when he is come he will rebuke ye worlde of synne and of rightwesnes and of iudgement.
043	JOH	016	009	Of synne because they beleve not on me:
043	JOH	016	010	Of rightwesnes because I go to my father and ye shall se me no moare:
043	JOH	016	011	and of iudgement because the chefe ruler of this worlde is iudged all ready.
043	JOH	016	012	I have yet many thinges to saye vnto you: but ye canot beare them awaye now.
043	JOH	016	013	How be it when he is come (I meane the sprete of truthe) he will leade yon into all trueth.  He shall not speake of him selfe: but whatsoever he shall heare that shall he speake and he will shewe you thinges to come.
043	JOH	016	014	He shall glorify me for he shall receave of myne and shall shewe vnto you.
043	JOH	016	015	All thinges that ye father hath aremyne.  Therfore sayd I vnto you that he shall take of myne and shewe vnto you.
043	JOH	016	016	After a whyle ye shall not se me and agayne after a whyle ye shall se me: For I goo to the father.
043	JOH	016	017	Then sayd some of his disciples bitwene them selves: what is this yt he sayth vnto vs after a whyle ye shall not se me and agayne after a whyle ye shall se me: and that I go to the father.
043	JOH	016	018	They sayd therfore: what is this that he sayth after a whyle?  we canot tell what he sayth.
043	JOH	016	019	Iesus perceaved yt they wolde axe him and sayd vnto them: This is it that ye enquyre of bitwene youre selves that I sayd after a whyle ye shall not se me and agayne after a whyle ye shall se me.
043	JOH	016	020	Verely verely I saye vnto you: ye shall wepe and lamet and the worlde shall reioyce.  Ye shall sorowe: but youre sorowe shalbe tourned to ioye.
043	JOH	016	021	A woman when she traveyleth hath sorowe because her houre is come: but assone as she is delivered of the chylde she remembreth no moare the anguysshe for ioye that a man is borne in to the worlde
043	JOH	016	022	And ye now are in sorowe: but I will se you agayne and youre hertes shall reioyce and youre ioye shall no ma take fro you.
043	JOH	016	023	And in that daye shall ye axe me no question.  Verely verely I saye vnto you whatsoever ye shall axe the father in my name he will geve it you
043	JOH	016	024	Hitherto have ye axed nothinge in my name.  Axe and ye shall receave it: that youre ioye maye be full.
043	JOH	016	025	These thinges have I spoken vnto you in proverbes.  The tyme will come when I shall no moare speake to you in proverbes: but I shall shewe you playnly from my father.
043	JOH	016	026	At that daye shall ye axe in myne name.  And I saye not vnto you that I will speake vnto my father for you
043	JOH	016	027	For ye father him selfe loveth you because ye have loved me and have beleved that I came out from God.
043	JOH	016	028	I went out from the father and came into the worlde: and I leve the worlde agayne and go to ye father.
043	JOH	016	029	His disciples sayd vnto him: loo now speakest thou playnly and thou vsest no proverbe.
043	JOH	016	030	Nowe knowe we that thou vnderstondest all thinges and nedest not yt eny man shuld axe the eny question.  Therfore beleve we that thou camst fro god.
043	JOH	016	031	Iesus answered them: Now ye do beleve.
043	JOH	016	032	Beholde ye houre draweth nye and is already come yt ye shalbe scatered every man his wayes and shall leave me alone.  And yet am I not alone.  For ye father is with me.
043	JOH	016	033	These wordes have I spoke vnto you yt in me ye might have peace.  For in ye worlde shall ye have tribulacio: but be of good cheare I have over come the worlde.
043	JOH	017	001	These wordes spake Iesus and lyfte vp his eyes to heven and sayde: father the houre is come: glorify thy sonne that thy sonne maye glorify the:
043	JOH	017	002	as thou hast geve him power over all fleshe that he shuld geve eternall lyfe to as many as thou hast geven him.
043	JOH	017	003	This is lyfe eternall that they myght knowe the that only very God and whom thou hast sent Iesus Christ.
043	JOH	017	004	I have glorified ye on the erth.  I have fynysshed ye worke which thou gavest me to do.
043	JOH	017	005	And now glorify me thou father wt thyn awne selfe with the glory which I had with ye yerre ye worlde was.
043	JOH	017	006	I have declared thy name vnto ye men which thou gavest me out of the worlde.  Thyne they were and thou gavest them me and they have kept thy sayinges.
043	JOH	017	007	Now they knowe that all thinges whatsoever thou hast geven me are of the.
043	JOH	017	008	For I have geven vnto them the wordes which thou gavest me and they have receaved them and knowe surely that I came out from the: and doo beleve that thou dyddest send me.
043	JOH	017	009	I praye for them and praye not for the worlde: but for the which thou hast geve me for they are thyne.
043	JOH	017	010	And all myne are thyne and thyne are myne and I am glorified in the.
043	JOH	017	011	And now am I no moare in the worlde but they are in the worlde and I come to ye.  Wholy father kepe in thyne awne name the which thou hast geven me that they maye be one as we are.
043	JOH	017	012	Whyll I was with the in ye worlde I kepte the in thy name.  Those yt thou gavest me have I kepte and none of the is lost but that lost chylde that the scripture myght be fulfilled.
043	JOH	017	013	Now come I to the and these wordes speake I in the worlde that they myght have my ioye full in the.
043	JOH	017	014	I have geven them thy wordes and the worlde hath hated them because they are not of the worlde even as I am not of the worlde.
043	JOH	017	015	I desyre not that thou shuldest take the out of the worlde: but that thou kepe them from evyll.
043	JOH	017	016	They are not of the worlde as I am not of the worlde.
043	JOH	017	017	Sanctify the wt thy truth.  Thy sayinge is truth.
043	JOH	017	018	As thou dyddest send me into the worlde even so have I sent them into the worlde
043	JOH	017	019	and for their sakes sanctify I my selfe that they also myght be sanctified thorowe the trueth.
043	JOH	017	020	I praye not for them alone: but for them also which shall beleve on me thorowe their preachynge
043	JOH	017	021	that they all maye be one as thou father arte in me and I in the that they maye be also one in vs that the worlde maye beleve that thou hast sent me.
043	JOH	017	022	And that glory that thou gavest me I have geven them that they maye be one as we are wone.
043	JOH	017	023	I in them and thou in me that they maye be made perfecte in one and that the worlde maye knowe that thou hast sent me and hast loved them as thou hast loved me.
043	JOH	017	024	Father I will that they which thou hast geven me be with me where I am that they maye se my glory which thou hast geven me.  For thou lovedest me before the makynge of the worlde.
043	JOH	017	025	O ryghteous father ye very worlde hath not knowen the: but I have knowen the and these have knowen that thou hast sent me.
043	JOH	017	026	And I have declared vnto them thy name and will declare it that the love wher wt thou hast loved me be in them and that I be in them.
043	JOH	018	001	When Iesus had spoken these wordes he wet forth with his disciples over the broke Cedron where was a garden into the which he entred with his disciples.
043	JOH	018	002	Iudas also which betrayed him knewe the place: for Iesus ofte tymes resorted thyther with his disciples.
043	JOH	018	003	Iudas then after he had receaved abonde of men and ministres of the hye Prestes and Pharises came thyther with lanterns and fyerbrondes and wepens.
043	JOH	018	004	Then Iesus knowynge all thinges that shuld come on him went forth and sayde vnto them: whom seke ye?
043	JOH	018	005	They answered him: Iesus of Nazareth.  Iesus sayde vnto them: I am he.  Iudas also which betrayed him stode with them.
043	JOH	018	006	But assone as he had sayd vnto them I am he they went backe wardes and fell to the grounde.
043	JOH	018	007	And he axed the agayne: whome seke ye?  They sayde: Iesus of Nazareth.
043	JOH	018	008	Iesus answered I sayde vnto you I am he.  If ye seke me let these goo their waye.
043	JOH	018	009	That ye sayinge might be fulfilled which he spake: of the which thou gavest me have I not lost one.
043	JOH	018	010	Simon Peter had a swearde and drue it and smote the hye prestes servaunt and cut of his ryght eare.  The servauntes name was Malchas.
043	JOH	018	011	Then sayde Iesus vnto Peter: put vp thy swearde into ye sheath: shall I not drinke of ye cup which my father hath geven me?
043	JOH	018	012	Then the copany and the captayne and the ministres of of the Iewes toke Iesus and bounde him
043	JOH	018	013	and led him awaye to Anna fyrst: For he was fatherelawe vnto Cayphas which was ye hye preste that same yeare.
043	JOH	018	014	Cayphas was he that gave counsell to ye Iewes that it was expediet that one man shuld dye for the people.
043	JOH	018	015	And Simon Peter folowed Iesus and another disciple: that disciple was knowen of ye hye preste and went in with Iesus into the pallys of the hye preste.
043	JOH	018	016	But Peter stode at the dore with out.  Then went out that other disciple which was knowen vnto the hye preste and spake to the damsell that kept the dore and brought in Peter.
043	JOH	018	017	Then sayde ye damsell that kept the dore vnto Peter: Arte not thou one of this mannes disciples?  He sayde: I am not.
043	JOH	018	018	The servauntes and the ministres stode there and had made a fyre of coles: for it was colde: and they warmed them selves.  Peter also stode amonge them and warmed him selfe.
043	JOH	018	019	The hye preste axed Iesus of his disciples and of his doctrine.
043	JOH	018	020	Iesus answered him: I spake openly in ye worlde.  I ever taught in ye synagoge and in the temple whyther all ye Iewes resorted and in secrete have I sayde nothynge:
043	JOH	018	021	Why axest thou me?  Axe them whiche hearde me what I sayde vnto the.  Beholde they can tell what I sayde.
043	JOH	018	022	Whe he had thus spoken one of ye ministres which stode by smote Iesus on the face sayinge: answerest thou the hyepreste so?
043	JOH	018	023	Iesus answered him.  If I have evyll spoke beare witnes of ye evyll: yf I have well spoke why smytest thou me?
043	JOH	018	024	And Annas sent him bounde vnto Caiphas ye hye preste.
043	JOH	018	025	Simon Peter stode and warmed him selfe.  And they sayde vnto him: arte not thou also one of his disciples?  He denyed it and sayde: I am not.
043	JOH	018	026	One of the servauntes of the hye preste (his cosyn whose eare Peter smote of) sayde vnto him: dyd not I se the in the garden with him?
043	JOH	018	027	Peter denyed it agayne: and immediatly the cocke crewe.
043	JOH	018	028	Then led they Iesus fro Cayphas into the hall of iudgement.  It was in the mornynge and they them selves went not into the iudgement hall lest they shuld be defyled but that they myght eate the paschall lambe.
043	JOH	018	029	Pylate then went out vnto the and sayde: what accusacion bringe ye agaynste this man?
043	JOH	018	030	They answered and sayd vnto him.  If he were not an evyll doar we wolde not have delyvered him vnto the.
043	JOH	018	031	Then sayd Pylate vnto the: take ye him and iudge him after youre awne lawe.  Then the Iewes sayde vnto him.  It is not lawfull for vs to put eny ma to deeth.
043	JOH	018	032	That ye wordes of Iesus myght be fulfilled which he spake signifyinge what deeth he shuld dye.
043	JOH	018	033	Then Pylate entred into the iudgemet hall agayne and called Iesus and sayd vnto him: arte thou the kynge of ye Iewes?
043	JOH	018	034	Iesus answered: sayst thou that of thy selfe or dyd other tell it the of me?
043	JOH	018	035	Pylate answered: Am I a Iewe?  Thyne awne nacion and hye prestes have delyvered ye vnto me.  What hast thou done?
043	JOH	018	036	Iesus answered: my kyngdome is not of this worlde.  Yf my kyngdome were of this worlde then wolde my ministres suerly fight yt I shuld not be delyvered to ye Iewes but now is my kyngdome not fro hence.
043	JOH	018	037	Pylate sayde vnto him: Arte thou a kynge then?  Iesus answered: Thou sayst yt I am a kynge.  For this cause was I borne and for this cause came I into ye worlde yt I shuld beare witnes vnto the trueth.  And all that are of ye trueth heare my voyce.
043	JOH	018	038	Pilate sayde vnto him: what thinge is trueth?  And when he had sayd yt he went out agayne vnto the Iewes and sayde vnto them: I fynde in him no cause at all.
043	JOH	018	039	Ye have a custome that I shuld delyver you one lowsse at ester.  Will ye that I lowse vnto you the kynge of ye Iewes.
043	JOH	018	040	Then cryed they all agayne sayinge: Not him but Barrabas that Barrabas was a robber.
043	JOH	019	001	Then Pylate toke Iesus and scourged him.
043	JOH	019	002	And ye soudiers wounde a croune of thornes and put it on his heed.  And they dyd on him a purple garment
043	JOH	019	003	and sayd: hayll kynge of the Iewes: and they smote him on the face.
043	JOH	019	004	Pylate went forthe agayne and sayde vnto them: beholde I bringe him forth to you that ye maye knowe that I fynde no faute in him.
043	JOH	019	005	Then came Iesus forthe wearynge a croune of thorne and a robe of purple.  And Pylate sayd vnto them: beholde ye man.
043	JOH	019	006	When the hye Prestes and ministres sawe him they cryed sayinge: crucify him crucify him.  Pylate sayde vnto them.  Take ye him and crucify him: for I fynde no cause in him.
043	JOH	019	007	The Iewes answered him.  We have a lawe and by oure lawe he ought to dye: because he made him selfe the sonne of God.
043	JOH	019	008	When Pylate hearde that sayinge he was the moare afrayde
043	JOH	019	009	and went agayne into ye iudgment hall and sayde vnto Iesus: whence arte thou?  But Iesus gave him none answere.
043	JOH	019	010	Then sayde Pylate vnto him.  Speakest thou not vnto me?  knowest thou not that I have power to crucify the and have power to lowse the?
043	JOH	019	011	Iesus answered: Thou couldest have no power at all agaynst me except it were geven the from above.  Therfore he yt delyvered me vnto the is moare in synne.
043	JOH	019	012	And from thence forthe sought Pylate meanes to lowse him: but the Iewes cryed sayinge: yf thou let him goo thou arte not Cesars frende.  For whosoever maketh hi selfe a kynge is agaynst Cesar
043	JOH	019	013	When Pylate hearde yt sayinge he brought Iesus forthe and sate doune to geve sentece in a place called the pavement: but in the Hebrue tonge Gabbatha.
043	JOH	019	014	It was the Saboth even which falleth in the ester fest and aboute the sixte houre.  And he sayde vnto the Iewes: beholde youre kynge.
043	JOH	019	015	They cryed awaye with him awaye with him crucify him.  Pylate sayde vnto them.  Shall I crucify youre kynge?  The hye Prestes answered: we have no kynge but Cesar.
043	JOH	019	016	Then delyvered he him vnto them to be crucified.  And they toke Iesus and led him awaye.
043	JOH	019	017	And he bare his crosse and went forthe into a place called the place of deed mens sculles which is named in Hebrue Golgatha.
043	JOH	019	018	Where they crucified him and two other with him on ether syde one and Iesus in the myddes.
043	JOH	019	019	And Pylate wrote his tytle and put it on the crosse.  The writynge was Iesus of Nazareth kynge of the Iewes.
043	JOH	019	020	This tytle reed many of the Iewes.  For the place where Iesus was crucified was nye to the cite.  And it was written in Hebrue Greke and Latyn.
043	JOH	019	021	Then sayde the hye prestes of ye Iewes to Pylate: wryte not kynge of the Iewes: but that he sayde I am kynge of the Iewes.
043	JOH	019	022	Pylate answered: what I have written that have I written.
043	JOH	019	023	Then the soudiers when they had crucified Iesus toke his garmentes and made foure partes to every soudier a parte and also his coote.  The coote was with out seme wrought vpon thorowe out.
043	JOH	019	024	And they sayde one to another.  Let vs not devyde it: but cast loostes who shall have it That the scripture myght be fulfilled which sayth.  They parted my rayment amonge them and on my coote dyd cast lottes.  And the soudiers dyd soche thinges in dede.
043	JOH	019	025	Ther stode by the crosse of Iesus his mother and his mothers sister Mary the wyfe of Cleophas and Mary Magdalene.
043	JOH	019	026	When Iesus sawe his mother and the disciple stondynge whom he loved he sayde vnto his mother: woman beholde thy sonne.
043	JOH	019	027	Then sayde he to ye disciple: beholde thy mother.  And fro that houre the disciple toke her for his awne.
043	JOH	019	028	After that when Iesus perceaved that all thinges were performed: that the scripture myght be fulfilled he sayde: I thyrst.
043	JOH	019	029	Ther stode a vessell full of veneger by.  And they filled a sponge with veneger and wounde it about with ysope and put it to his mouth.
043	JOH	019	030	Assone as Iesus had receaved of the veneger he sayd: It is fynesshed and bowed his heed and gaue vp the goost.
043	JOH	019	031	The Iewes then because it was the saboth eve that ye bodyes shuld not remayne apon ye crosse on ye saboth daye (for that saboth daye was an hye daye) besought Pylate that their legges myght be broken and that they myght be taken doune.
043	JOH	019	032	Then came the soudiers and brake the legges of the fyrst and of the other which was crucified with Iesus.
043	JOH	019	033	But when they came to Iesus and sawe that he was deed already they brake not his legges:
043	JOH	019	034	but one of the soudiers with a speare thrust him into the syde and forthwith came ther out bloud and water.
043	JOH	019	035	And he that sawe it bare recorde and his recorde is true.  And he knoweth that he sayth true that ye myght beleve also.
043	JOH	019	036	These thinges were done that the scripture shuld be fulfilled: Ye shall not breake a boone of him.
043	JOH	019	037	And agayne another scripture sayth: They shall looke on him whom they pearsed.
043	JOH	019	038	After that Ioseph of Aramathia (which was a disciple of Iesus: but secretly for feare of ye Iewes) besought Pylate that he myght take doune the body of Iesus.  And Pylate gave him licence.
043	JOH	019	039	And ther cam also Nicodemus which at the beginnynge came to Iesus by nyght and brought of myrre and aloes mingled to gether aboute an hundred pounde wayght
043	JOH	019	040	Then toke they the body of Iesu and wounde it in lynnen clothes with the odoures as ye maner of the Iewes is to bury.
043	JOH	019	041	And in the place where Iesus was crucified was a garden and in ye garden a newe sepulchre wherin was never man layd.
043	JOH	019	042	There layde they Iesus because of the Iewes saboth even for the sepulcre was nye at honde.
043	JOH	020	001	The morow after the saboth daye came Mary Magdalene erly when it was yet darcke vnto ye sepulcre and sawe the stone taken awaye from ye toumbe.
043	JOH	020	002	Then she ranne and came to Simon Peter and to the other disciple whome Iesus loved and sayde vnto them.  They have taken awaye the Lorde out of the toumbe and we cannot tell where they have layde him.
043	JOH	020	003	Peter went forth and that other disciple and came vnto the sepulcre.
043	JOH	020	004	They ranne bothe to gether and that other disciple dyd out runne Peter and came fyrst to the sepulcre.
043	JOH	020	005	And he stouped doune and sawe the lynnen clothes lyinge yet wet he not in.
043	JOH	020	006	Then came Simon Peter folowynge him and went into ye sepulcre and sawe the lynnen clothes lye
043	JOH	020	007	and the napkyn that was aboute his heed not lyinge with the lynnen clothe but wrapped togeder in a place by it selfe.
043	JOH	020	008	Then went in also that other disciple which came fyrst to the sepulcre and he sawe and beleved.
043	JOH	020	009	For as yet they knew not the scriptures that he shuld ryse agayne from deeth.
043	JOH	020	010	And the disciples wet awaye agayne vnto their awne home.
043	JOH	020	011	Mary stode with out at the sepulcre wepynge.  And as she wept she bowed her selfe into the sepulcre
043	JOH	020	012	and sawe two angels in whyte sittyng the one at the heed and the other at the fete where they had layde the body of Iesus.
043	JOH	020	013	And they sayde vnto her: woman why wepest thou?  She sayde vnto the: For they have taken awaye my lorde and I wote not where they have layde him.
043	JOH	020	014	When she had thus sayde she turned her selfe backe and sawe Iesus stondynge and knewe not that it was Iesus.
043	JOH	020	015	Iesus sayde vnto her: woman why wepest thou?  Whom sekest thou?  She supposynge that he had bene the gardener sayde vnto him.  Syr yf thou have borne him hece tell me where thou hast layde him that I maye fet him.
043	JOH	020	016	Iesus sayde vnto her: Mary.  She turned her selfe and sayde vnto him: Rabboni which is to saye master.
043	JOH	020	017	Iesus sayde vnto her touche me not for I am not yet ascended to my father.  But goo to my brethren and saye vnto them I ascende vnto my father and youre father to: my god and youre god.
043	JOH	020	018	Mary Magdalene came and tolde the disciples yt she had sene the lorde and yt he had spoken soche thinges vnto her.
043	JOH	020	019	The same daye at nyght which was the morowe after ye saboth daye when the dores were shut where the disciples were assembled to geder for feare of the Iewes came Iesus and stode in the myddes and sayd to the: peace be with you.
043	JOH	020	020	And when he had so sayde he shewed vnto them his hondes and his syde.  Then were the disciples glad when they sawe the Lorde.
043	JOH	020	021	Then sayde Iesus to them agayne: peace be with you.  As my father sent me even so sende I you.
043	JOH	020	022	And when he had sayde that he brethed on them and sayde vnto the: Receave ye holy goost.
043	JOH	020	023	Whosoevers synnes ye remyt they are remitted vnto the.  And whosoevers synnes ye retayne they are retayned.
043	JOH	020	024	But Thomas one of ye twelve called Didymus was not with the when Iesus came.
043	JOH	020	025	The other disciples sayd vnto him: we have sene ye lorde.  And he sayde vnto the: except I se in his hondes the prent of the nayles and put my fynger in the holes of the nayles and thrust my honde into his syde I will not beleve.
043	JOH	020	026	And after. viii.  dayes agayne his disciples were with in and Thomas with them.  Then came Iesus when the dores were shut and stode in the myddes and sayde: peace be with you.
043	JOH	020	027	After that sayde he to Thomas: bringe thy fynger hether and se my hondes and bringe thy honde and thrust it into my syde and be not faythlesse but belevynge.
043	JOH	020	028	Thomas answered and sayde vnto him: my Lorde and my God.
043	JOH	020	029	Iesus sayde vnto him.  Thomas because thou hast sene me therfore thou belevest: Happy are they that have not sene and yet beleve.
043	JOH	020	030	And many other signes dyd Iesus in the presence of his disciples which are not written in this boke.
043	JOH	020	031	These are written that ye myght beleve that Iesus is Christ the sonne of God and that in belevynge ye myght have lyfe thorowe his name.
043	JOH	021	001	After that Iesus shewed him selfe agayne at the see of Tyberias.  And on this wyse shewed he him selfe.
043	JOH	021	002	There were to geder Simon Peter and Thomas which is called Didymus: and Nathanael of Cana a citie of Galile and the sonnes of Zebedei and two other of the disciples.
043	JOH	021	003	Simon Peter sayde vnto them: I goo a fysshynge.  They sayde vnto him: we also will goo with the.  They wet their waye and entred into a shippe strayght waye and that nyght caught they nothinge.
043	JOH	021	004	But when the mornynge was now come Iesus stode on the shore: neverthelesse the disciples knewe not yt it was Iesus.
043	JOH	021	005	Iesus sayde vnto the: syrs have ye eny meate?  They answered him no.
043	JOH	021	006	And he sayde vnto them: cast out ye net on the ryght syde of the ship and ye shall fynde.  They cast out and anone they were not able to drawe it for ye multitude of fysshes
043	JOH	021	007	Then sayde the disciple whom Iesus loved vnto Peter: It is the Lorde.  When Simon Peter hearde that it was ye lorde he gyrde his mantell to him (for he was naked) and sprange into the see
043	JOH	021	008	The other disciples came by ship: for they were not farre from londe but as it were two hondred cubites and they drewe the net with fysshes.
043	JOH	021	009	Assone as they were come to londe they sawe hoot coles and fysshe layd ther on and breed.
043	JOH	021	010	Iesus sayde vnto them: bringe of the fysshe which ye have now caught.
043	JOH	021	011	Simon Peter stepped forthe and drewe the net to londe full of greate fysshes an hondred and. liii.  And for all ther were so many yet was not the net broken.
043	JOH	021	012	Iesus sayde vnto them: come and dyne.  And none of the disciples durste axe him: what arte thou?  For they knewe that it was the lorde.
043	JOH	021	013	Iesus then came and toke breed and gave them and fysshe lykwyse
043	JOH	021	014	And this is now the thyrde tyme that Iesus appered to his disciples after that he was rysen agayne from deeth.
043	JOH	021	015	When they had dyned Iesus sayde to Simon Peter: Simon Ioana lovest thou me more then these?  He sayde vnto him: ye Lorde thou knowest that I love the.  He sayde vnto him: fede my lambes.
043	JOH	021	016	He sayde to him agayne the seconde tyme: Simo Ioana lovest thou me?  He sayde vnto him: ye lorde thou knowest that I love ye.  He sayde vnto him: fede my shepe.
043	JOH	021	017	He sayde vnto him ye thyrde tyme: Simon Ioanna lovest thou me?  And Peter sorowed because he sayde to him ye thyrde tyme lovest thou me and sayde vnto him: Lorde thou knowest all thinge thou knowest that I love the.  Iesus sayde vnto him: fede my shepe.
043	JOH	021	018	Verely verely I saye vnto the when thou wast yonge thou gerdedst thy selfe and walkedst whyther thou woldest: but when thou arte olde thou shalt stretche forthe thy hondes and a nother shall gyrde ye and leade the whyther thou woldest not.
043	JOH	021	019	That spake he signifyinge by what deeth he shuld glorify God.  And whe he had sayde thus he sayd to him folowe me.
043	JOH	021	020	Peter turned about and sawe that disciple who Iesus loved folowynge: which also lened on his brest at supper and sayde: Lorde which is he yt shall betraye the?
043	JOH	021	021	When Peter sawe him he sayde to Iesus: Lorde what shall he here do?
043	JOH	021	022	Iesus sayd vnto him Yf I will have him to tary tyll I come what is that to the?  folowe thou me.
043	JOH	021	023	Then went this sayinge a broode amonge the brethren that that disciple shulde not dye.  Yet Iesus sayde not to him he shall not dye: but yf I will that he tary tyll I come what is that to the?
043	JOH	021	024	The same disciple is he which testifieth of these thinges and wrote these thinges.  And we knowe that his testimony is true.
043	JOH	021	025	There are also many other thinges which Iesus dyd: the which yf they shuld be written every won I suppose the worlde coulde not cotayne the bokes that shuld be written.

044	ACT	020	016	for Paul had determined to leave Ephesus as they sayled because he wolde not spende ye tyme in Asia.  For he hasted to be (yf he coulde possible) at Ierusalem at the daye of pentecoste.
044	ACT	020	017	Wherfore from Myleton he sent to Ephesus and called the elders of the cogregacion.
044	ACT	020	018	And when they were come to him he sayde vnto the: Ye knowe fro the fyrst daye yt I came vnto Asia after what maner I have bene wt you at all ceasons

044	ACT	028	016	And when he came to Rome ye vnder captayne delyvered ye presoners to ye chefe captayne of ye host: but Paul was suffered to dwell by him selfe with one soudier that kept him.
044	ACT	028	017	And it fortuned after thre dayes that Paul called ye chefe of ye Iewes together.  And whe they were come he sayde vnto the: Men and brethren though I have comitted nothinge agaynst the people or lawes of oure fathers: yet was I delyvered presoner from Ierusalem in to the hondes of ye Romayns.
044	ACT	028	018	Which when they had examined me wolde have let me goo because they founde no cause of deeth in me.
044	ACT	028	019	But when ye Iewes cryed cotrary I was constrayned to appeale vnto Cesar: not because I had ought to accuse my people of.
044	ACT	028	020	For this cause have I called for you eve to se you and to speake with you: because that for the hope of Israel I am bounde with this chayne.

044	ACT	028	022	But we will heare of the what thou thynkest.  For we have hearde of this secte that every wheare it is spoken agaynst.
044	ACT	028	023	And when they had apoynted him a daye ther came many vnto him into his lodgynge.  To whom he expounded and testifyed the kyngdome of God and preached vnto the of Iesu: both out of the lawe of Moses and also out of the prophetes even from mornynge to nyght.
044	ACT	028	024	And some beleved ye thinges which were spoken and some beleved not.
044	ACT	028	025	When they agreed not amonge the selves they departed after that Paul had spoken one worde.  Well spake the holy goost by Esay ye prophet vnto oure fathers
044	ACT	028	026	sayinge: Goo vnto this people and saye: with youre eares shall ye heare and shall not vnderstonde: and with youre eyes shall ye se and shall not perceave.
044	ACT	028	027	For the hert of this people is wexed grosse and their eares were thycke of hearynge and their eyes have they closed: lest they shuld se with their eyes and heare with their eares and vnderstonde with their hertes and shuld be converted and I shulde heale them.

044	ACT	028	029	And when he had sayde that the Iewes departed and had grete despicios amonge them selves.
044	ACT	028	030	And Paul dwelt two yeares full in his lodgynge and receaved all that came to him

045	ROM	003	007	Yf the veritie of God appere moare excellent thorow my lye vnto his prayse why am I hence forth iudged as a synner?
045	ROM	003	008	and saye not rather (as men evyll speake of vs and as some affirme that we saye) let vs do evyll that good maye come therof.  Whose damnacion is iuste.
045	ROM	003	009	What saye we then?  Are we better then they?  No in no wyse.  For we have all ready proved how that both Iewes and Gentils are all vnder synne
045	ROM	003	010	as it is writte: There is none righteous no not one:
045	ROM	003	011	There is none that vnderstondith there is none yt seketh after God
045	ROM	003	012	they are all gone out of ye waye they are all made vnprofytable ther is none that doeth good no not one.
045	ROM	003	013	Their throte is an open sepulchre with their tounges they have disceaved: the poyson of Aspes is vnder their lippes.
045	ROM	003	014	Whose mouthes are full of coursynge and bitternes.
045	ROM	003	015	Their fete are swyfte to sheed bloud.
045	ROM	003	016	Destruccion and wretchednes are in their wayes.
045	ROM	003	017	And the waye of peace they have not knowen.
045	ROM	003	018	There is no feare of God before their eyes.
045	ROM	003	019	Ye and we knowe that whatsoever ye lawe sayth he sayth it to them which are vnder the lawe.  That all mouthes maye be stopped and all the worlde be subdued to god
045	ROM	003	020	because that by ye dedes of the lawe shall no flesshe be iustified in the sight of God.  For by the lawe commeth the knowledge of synne.
045	ROM	003	021	Now verely is ye rigtewesnes that cometh of God declared without the fulfillinge of ye lawe havinge witnes yet of ye lawe and of the Prophetes.
045	ROM	003	022	The rightewesnes no dout which is good before God cometh by ye fayth of Iesus Christ vnto all and vpon all that beleve.  Ther is no differece:
045	ROM	003	023	for all have synned and lacke the prayse yt is of valoure before God:
045	ROM	003	024	but are iustified frely by his grace through the redemcion that is in Christ Iesu
045	ROM	003	025	whom God hath made a seate of mercy thorow faith in his bloud to shewe ye rightewesnes which before him is of valoure in yt he forgeveth ye synnes yt are passed which God dyd suffre
045	ROM	003	026	to shewe at this tyme ye rightewesnes yt is alowed of him yt he myght be couted iuste and a iustifiar of him which belevith on Iesus.
045	ROM	003	027	Where is then thy reioysinge?  It is excluded.  By what lawe?  by ye lawe of workes?  Naye: but by the lawe of fayth.
045	ROM	003	028	For we suppose that a man is iustified by fayth without the dedes of ye lawe.
045	ROM	003	029	Is he the God of the Iewes only?  Is he not also the God of the Gentyls?  Yes eve of the Gentyles also.
045	ROM	003	030	For it is God only which iustifieth circumcision which is of fayth and vncircumcision thorow fayth.
045	ROM	003	031	Do we then destroye the lawe thorow fayth?  God forbid.  But we rather mayntayne the lawe.
045	ROM	004	001	What shall we saye then that Abraham oure father as pertayninge to ye flesshe dyd finde?
045	ROM	004	002	If Abraham were iustified by dedes the hath he wherin to reioyce: but not with god.
045	ROM	004	003	For what sayth the scripture?  Abraham beleved god and it was counted vnto him for rightewesnes.
045	ROM	004	004	To him that worketh is the rewarde not reckened of favour: but of duty.
045	ROM	004	005	To him that worketh not but beleveth on him that iustifieth the vngodly is his fayth counted for rightewesnes.
045	ROM	004	006	Even as David describeth the blessedfulnes of the man vnto whom god ascribeth rihgtewesnes without dedes.
045	ROM	004	007	Blessed are they whose vnrightewesnes are forgeven and whose synnes are covered.
045	ROM	004	008	Blessed is that ma to whom the Lorde imputeth not synne.
045	ROM	004	009	Came this blessednes then vpon the circumcised or vpon the vncircucised?  We saye verely how that fayth was rekened to Abraham for rightewesnes.
045	ROM	004	010	How was it rekened?  in the tyme of circumcision?  or in the tyme before he was circumcised?  Not in tyme of circucision: but when he was yet vncircumcised.
045	ROM	004	011	And he receaved the signe of circumcision as a seale of yt rightewesnes which is by fayth which fayth he had yet beynge vncircucised: that he shuld be the father of all them that beleve though they be not circumcised that rightewesnes myght be imputed to them also:
045	ROM	004	012	and that he myght be the father of the circumcised not because they are circumcised only: but because they walke also in the steppes of that fayth yt was in oure father Abraham before the tyme of circumcision.
045	ROM	004	013	For the promes that he shuld be the heyre of the worlde was not geven to Abraha or to his seed thorow the lawe: but thorow ye rightewesnes which cometh of fayth.
045	ROM	004	014	For yf they which are of the lawe be heyres then is fayth but vayne and the promes of none effecte.
045	ROM	004	015	Because the lawe causeth wrathe.  For where no lawe is there is no trasgression.
045	ROM	004	016	Therfore by fayth is the inheritauce geven that it myght come of faveour: and the promes myght be sure to all the seed.  Not to them only which are of the lawe: but also to them which are of the fayth of Abraham which is the father of vs all.
045	ROM	004	017	As it is wrytten: I have made the a father to many nacions even before god whom thou hast beleved which quyckeneth the deed and called those thinges which be not as though they were.
045	ROM	004	018	Which Abraham contrary to hope beleved in hope that he shuld be the father of many nacions accordynge to that which was spoken:
045	ROM	004	019	So shall thy seed be.  And he faynted not in the fayth nor yet consydered hys awne body which was now deed even when he was almost an hondred yeare olde: nether yet that Sara was past chyldeberinge.
045	ROM	004	020	He stackered not at the promes of God thorow vnbelefe: but was made stronge in the fayth and gave honour to God
045	ROM	004	021	full certifyed that what he had promised that he was able to make good.
045	ROM	004	022	And therfore was it reckened to him for rightewesnes.
045	ROM	004	023	It is not written for him only that it was reckened to him for rightewesnes:
045	ROM	004	024	but also for vs to whom it shalbe counted for rightewesnes so we beleve on him that raysed vp Iesus oure Lorde from deeth.
045	ROM	004	025	Which was delivered for oure synnes and rose agayne forto iustifie vs.
045	ROM	005	001	Because therfore that we are iustified by fayth we are at peace with god thorow oure Lorde Iesue Christ:
045	ROM	005	002	by who we have awaye in thorow fayth vnto this grace wherin we stonde aud reioyce in hope of the prayse that shalbe geven of God.
045	ROM	005	003	Nether do we so only: but also we reioyce in tribulacion.  For we know that tribulacion bringeth pacience
045	ROM	005	004	pacience bringeth experience experience bringeth hope.
045	ROM	005	005	And hope maketh not ashamed for the love of God is sheed abrod in oure hertes by the holy goost which is geven vnto vs.
045	ROM	005	006	For when we were yet weake accordynge to ye tyme: Christ dyed for vs which were vngodly.
045	ROM	005	007	Yet scace will eny man dye for a rightewes man.  Paraventure for a good ma durst a man dye.
045	ROM	005	008	But God setteth out his love that he hath to vs seinge that whyll we were yet synners Christ dyed for vs.
045	ROM	005	009	Moche more then now (seynge we are iustifyed in his bloud) shall we be saved from wrath thorow him.
045	ROM	005	010	For yf when we were enemyes we were reconciled to God by the deeth of his sonne: moche more seinge we are reconciled we shal be preservid by his lyfe.
045	ROM	005	011	Not only so but we also ioye in God by the meanes of oure Lorde Iesus Christ by whom we have receavyd the attonment.
045	ROM	005	012	Wherfore as by one ma synne entred into the worlde and deeth by the meanes of synne.  And so deeth went over all men in somoche that all men synned.
045	ROM	005	013	For even vnto the tyme of the lawe was synne in the worlde: but synne was not regarded as longe as ther was no lawe:
045	ROM	005	014	neverthelesse deeth rayned fro Adam to Moses eve over them also that synned not wt lyke transgression as dyd Adam: which is ye similitude of him that is to come.
045	ROM	005	015	But the gyfte is not lyke as the synne.  For yf thorow the synne of one many be deed: moche more plenteous vpon many was the grace of God and gyfte by grace: which grace was geven by one man Iesus Christ.
045	ROM	005	016	And ye gifte is not over one synne as deeth cam thorow one synne of one yt synned.  For damnacion cam of one synne vnto condemnacion: but the gyft cam to iustify fro many synnes.
045	ROM	005	017	For yf by the synne of one deeth raigned by the meanes of one moche more shall they which receave aboundance of grace and of the gyfte of rightewesnes raygne in lyfe by the meanes of one (that is to saye) Iesus Christ.
045	ROM	005	018	Lykewyse then as by the synne of one condemnacion cam on all men: eve so by the iustifyinge of one cometh the rightewesnes that bringeth lyfe vpo all men.
045	ROM	005	019	For as by one manes disobediece many be cam synners: so by ye obediece of one shall many be made righteous.
045	ROM	005	020	But ye lawe in the meane tyme entred in yt synne shuld encreace.  Neverthelater where aboundaunce of synne was there was more plenteousnes of grace.
045	ROM	005	021	That as synne had raigned vnto deeth even so might grace raygne thorow rightewesnes vnto eternall lyfe by the helpe of Iesu Christ.
045	ROM	006	001	What shall we saye then?  Shall we continue in synne that there maye be aboundaunce of grace?
045	ROM	006	002	God forbyd.  How shall we that are deed as touchynge synne live eny lenger therin?
045	ROM	006	003	Remember ye not that all we which are baptysed in the name of Iesu Christ are baptysed to dye with him?
045	ROM	006	004	We are buryed with him by baptim for to dye that lykewyse as Christ was raysed vp from deeth by the glorye of the father: eve so we also shuld walke in a newe lyfe.
045	ROM	006	005	For yf we be graft in deeth lyke vnto him: even so must we be in the resurreccio.
045	ROM	006	006	This we must remeber that oure olde man is crucified with him also that the body of synne myght vtterly be destroyed that hence forth we shuld not be servauntes of synne.
045	ROM	006	007	For he that is deed ys iustified from synne.
045	ROM	006	008	Wherfore yf we be deed with Christ we beleve that we shall live with him:
045	ROM	006	009	remembringe that Christ once raysed fro deeth dyeth no more.  Deeth hath no moare power over him.
045	ROM	006	010	For as touchynge that he dyed he dyed concernynge synne once.  And as touchinge that he liveth he liveth vnto God.
045	ROM	006	011	Lykewyse ymagen ye also that ye are deed concernynge synne: but are alive vnto God thorow Iesus Christ oure Lorde.
045	ROM	006	012	Let not synne raygne therfore in youre mortall bodyes that ye shuld thervnto obey in the lustes of it.
045	ROM	006	013	Nether geve ye youre members as instrumentes of vnrightewesnes vnto synne: but geve youre selves vnto God as they that are alive from deeth.  And geve youre membres as iustrumetes of rightewesnes vnto God.
045	ROM	006	014	Let not synne have power over you.  For ye are not vnder the lawe but vnder grace.
045	ROM	006	015	What then?  Shall we synne because we are not vnder the lawe: but vnder grace?  God forbyd.
045	ROM	006	016	Remember ye not how yt to whom soever ye comit youre selves as servautes to obey his servauntes ye are to whom ye obey: whether it be of synne vnto deeth or of obedience vnto rightewesnes?
045	ROM	006	017	God be thanked yt though ye were once the servauntes of synne ye have yet obeyed with herte vnto the forme of doctryne wher vnto ye were delyvered.
045	ROM	006	018	Ye are then made fre from synne and are be come the servauntes of rightewesnes.
045	ROM	006	019	I will speake grossly because of the infirmitie of youre flesshe.  As ye have geve youre membres servauntes to vnclennes and to iniquitie fro iniquitie vnto iniquitie: even so nowe geve youre membres servantes vnto rightewesnes yt ye maye be sanctified.
045	ROM	006	020	For when ye were the servauntes of synne ye were not vnder rightewesnes.
045	ROM	006	021	What frute had ye then in tho thinges wher of ye are now ashamed.  For the ende of tho thynges is deeth.
045	ROM	006	022	But now are ye delivered from synne and made the servauntes of God and have youre frute that ye shuld be sanctifyed and the ende everlastinge lyfe.
045	ROM	006	023	For the rewarde of synne is deeth: but eternall lyfe is the gyfte of God thorow Iesus Christ oure Lorde.
045	ROM	007	001	Remember ye not brethren (I speake to them yt know the lawe) how that the lawe hath power over a man as longe as it endureth?
045	ROM	007	002	For the woman which is in subieccion to a man is bounde by the lawe to the man as longe as he liveth.  Yf the man be deed she is lowsed from the lawe of the man.
045	ROM	007	003	So then yf whill the man liveth she couple her selfe with another man she shalbe counted a wedlocke breaker.  But yf the man be deed she is fre fro the lawe: so that she is no wedlocke breaker though she couple her selfe with another man.
045	ROM	007	004	Even so ye my brethren are deed concerninge the lawe by the body of Christ yt ye shuld be coupled to another (I meane to him that is rysen agayne fro deeth) that we shuld bringe forth frute vnto God.
045	ROM	007	005	For when we were in the flesshe the lustes of synne which were stered vppe by ye lawe raygned in oure membres to bringe forth frute vnto deeth.
045	ROM	007	006	But now are we delivered fro the lawe and deed fro that whervnto we werein bondage that we shuld serve in a newe conversacion of ye sprete and not in ye olde conversacion of the letter.
045	ROM	007	007	What shall we saye then?  is ye lawe synne?  God forbid: but I knewe not what synne meant but by the lawe.  For I had not knowne what lust had meant excepte the lawe had sayde thou shalt not lust.
045	ROM	007	008	But synne toke an occasion by the meanes of the commaundement and wrought in me all manner of concupiscece.  For with out the lawe synne was deed.
045	ROM	007	009	I once lived with out lawe.  But when the commaundement came synne revyved and I was deed.
045	ROM	007	010	And the very same comaundement which was ordeyned vnto lyfe was founde to be vnto me an occasion of deeth.
045	ROM	007	011	For synne toke occasion by the meanes of the comaundement and so disceaved me and by the selfe commaundement slewe we.
045	ROM	007	012	Wherfore the lawe is holy and the commaundement holy iust and good.
045	ROM	007	013	Was that then which is good made deeth vnto me?  God forbyd.  Naye synne was deeth vnto me that it myght appere how that synne by the meanes of that which is good had wrought deeth in me: that synne which is vnder the commandemet myght be out of measure synfull.
045	ROM	007	014	For we knowe that the lawe is spirituall: but I am carnall solde vnder synne
045	ROM	007	015	because I wote not what I doo.  For what I wold that do I not: but what I hate that do I.
045	ROM	007	016	Yf I do now that which I wolde not I graute to the lawe that it is good.
045	ROM	007	017	So then nowe it is not I that do it but synne that dwelleth in me.
045	ROM	007	018	For I knowe that in me (that is to saye in my flesshe) dwelleth no good thinge.  To will is present with me: but I fynde no meanes to performe that which is good.
045	ROM	007	019	For I doo not yt good thinge which I wold: but that evill do I which I wolde not.
045	ROM	007	020	Finally yf I do that I wolde not then is it not I that doo it but synne that dwelleth in me doeth it.
045	ROM	007	021	I fynde then by the lawe that when I wolde do good evyll is present with me.
045	ROM	007	022	I delite in the lawe of God concerninge the inner man.
045	ROM	007	023	But I se another lawe in my membres rebellinge agaynst the lawe of my mynde and subduynge me vnto the lawe of synne which is in my membres.
045	ROM	007	024	O wretched man yt I am: who shall delyver me fro this body of deeth?
045	ROM	007	025	I thanke God thorow Iesus Christ oure Lorde.  So then I my silfe in my mynde serve the lawe of God and in my flesshe the lawe of synne.
045	ROM	008	001	Ther is then no damnacion to them which are in Christ Iesu which walke not after ye flesshe: but after ye sprete.
045	ROM	008	002	For the lawe of the sprete yt bringeth life thorowe Iesus Christ hath delivered me fro the lawe of synne and deeth.
045	ROM	008	003	For what the lawe coulde not doo in as moche it was weake because of the flesshe: that performed God and sent his sonne in the similitude of synfull flesshe and by synne daned synne in ye flesshe:
045	ROM	008	004	that the rightewesnes requyred of the lawe myght be fulfilled in vs which walke not after the flesshe but after the sprete.
045	ROM	008	005	For they that are carnall are carnally mynded.  But they that are spirituall are gostly mynded.
045	ROM	008	006	To be carnally mynded is deeth.  But to be spiritually mynded is lyfe and peace.
045	ROM	008	007	Because that the flesshly mynde is emnyte agaynst God: for it is not obedient to the lawe of God nether can be.
045	ROM	008	008	So then they yt are geven to the flesshe canot please God.
045	ROM	008	009	But ye are not geven to the flesshe but to the sprete: yf so be that ye sprite of God dwell in you.  If ther be eny man yt hath not ye sprite of Christ ye same is none of his.
045	ROM	008	010	Yf Christ be in you the body is deed because of synne: but the sprite is lyfe for rightewesnes sake.
045	ROM	008	011	Wherfore if the sprite of him that raysed vppe Iesus fro deeth dwell in you: even he that raysed vp Christ from deeth shall quycken youre mortall bodyes because that this sprite dwelleth in you.
045	ROM	008	012	Therfore brethren we are nowe detters not to the flesshe to live after the flesshe.
045	ROM	008	013	For if ye live after the flesshe ye must dye.  But yf ye mortifie the dedes of the body by the helpe of the sprite ye shall lyve.
045	ROM	008	014	For as many as are led by the sprete of God: they are the sonnes of god.
045	ROM	008	015	For ye have no receaved the sprete of bondage to feare eny moare but ye have receaved the sprite of adopcion wherby we crye Abba father.
045	ROM	008	016	The same sprete certifieth oure sprete yt we are the sonnes of God.
045	ROM	008	017	Yf we be sonnes we are also heyres the heyres I meane of God and heyres anexed with Christ: if so be that we suffer togedder that we maye be glorified to gedder.
045	ROM	008	018	For I suppose that the affliccions of this lyfe are not worthy of the glory which shalbe shewed vpon vs.
045	ROM	008	019	Also the fervent desyre of the creatures abideth lokynge when the sonnes of God shall appere
045	ROM	008	020	because the creatures are subdued to vanyte agaynst their will: but for his will which subdueth them in hope.
045	ROM	008	021	For ye very creatures shalbe delivered from the bondage of corrupcion into the glorious lybertie of the sonnes of God.
045	ROM	008	022	For we knowe that every creature groneth with vs also and travayleth in payne even vnto this tyme.
045	ROM	008	023	Not they only but even we also which have the fyrst frutes of the sprite morne in oureselves and wayte for the (adopcio) and loke for the delivraunce of oure bodyes.
045	ROM	008	024	For we are savyd by hope.  But hope that is sene is no hope.  For how can a ma hope for that which he seyth?
045	ROM	008	025	But and yf we hope for that we se not then do we with pacience abyde for it.
045	ROM	008	026	Lyke wyse ye sprite also helpeth oure infirmities.  For we knowe not what to desyre as we ought: but the sprete maketh intercession mightely for vs with gronynges which canot be expressid with tonge.
045	ROM	008	027	And he that searcheth the hertes knoweth what is ye meaninge of the sprite: for he maketh intercession for the sayntes accordinge to ye pleasure of god.
045	ROM	008	028	For we knowe that all thinges worke for the best vnto them yt love God which also are called of purpose.
045	ROM	008	029	For those which he knewe before he also ordeyned before yt they shuld be lyke fassioned vnto the shape of his sonne that he myght be ye fyrst begotten sonne amoge many brethren.
045	ROM	008	030	Morover which he apoynted before them he also called.  And which he called them also he iustified which he iustified them he also glorified.
045	ROM	008	031	What shall we then saye vnto these thinges?  yf god be on oure syde: who can be agaynst vs?
045	ROM	008	032	which spared not his awne sonne but gave him for vs all: how shall he not wt him geve vs all thinges also?
045	ROM	008	033	Who shall laye eny thinge to ye charge of goddes chosen?  it is god that iustifieth:
045	ROM	008	034	who then shall condempne?  it is Christ which is deed ye rather which is rysen agayne which is also on the ryght honde of God and maketh intercession for vs.
045	ROM	008	035	Who shall seperate vs fro the love of god?  shall tribulacion?  or anguysshe?  or persecucion?  other honger?  other nakednesse?  other parell?  other swearde?
045	ROM	008	036	As it is written: For thy sake are we kylled all daye longe and are counted as shepe apoynted to be slayne.
045	ROM	008	037	Neverthelesse in all these thinges we overcome strongly thorow his helpe that loved vs.
045	ROM	008	038	Ye and I am sure that nether deeth nether lyfe nether angels nor rule nether power nether thinges present nether thinges to come
045	ROM	008	039	nether heyth nether loweth nether eny other creature shalbe able to departe vs fro ye love of God shewed in Christ Iesu oure lorde.
045	ROM	009	001	I saye the trueth in Christ and lye not in that wherof my conscience beareth me witnes in the holy gost
045	ROM	009	002	that I have gret hevynes and continuall sorowe in my hert.
045	ROM	009	003	For I have wysshed my selfe to be cursed from Christ for my brethren and my kynsmen as pertayninge to the flesshe
045	ROM	009	004	which are the Israelites.  To whom pertayneth the adopcion and the glorie and the covenauntes and the law that was geven and the service of God and the promyses:
045	ROM	009	005	whose also are the fathers and they of whome (as concernynge the flesshe) Christ came which is God over all thinges blessed for ever Amen.
045	ROM	009	006	I speake not these thinges as though the wordes of god had take none effecte.  For they are not all Israelites which came of Israel:
045	ROM	009	007	nether are they all chyldren strayght waye because they are the seed of Abraham.  But in Isaac shall thy seede be called:
045	ROM	009	008	that is to saye they which are the chyldren of the flesshe are not the chyldren of god.  But the chyldren of promes are counted the seede.
045	ROM	009	009	For this is a worde of promes aboute this tyme will I come and Sara shall have a sonne.
045	ROM	009	010	Nether was it so wt her only: but also when Rebecca was with chylde by one I meane by oure father Isaac
045	ROM	009	011	yeer the chyldren were borne when they had nether done good nether bad: that the purpose of God which is by election myght stonde
045	ROM	009	012	it was sayde vnto her not by the reason of workes but by grace of ye caller: the elder shall serve the yonger.
045	ROM	009	013	As it is written: Iacob he loved but Esau he hated.
045	ROM	009	014	What shall we saye then?  is there eny vnrightewesses with God?  God forbyd.
045	ROM	009	015	For he sayth to Moses: I will shewe mercye to who I shewe mercy: and will have compassion on whom I have copassion.
045	ROM	009	016	So lieth it not then in a mans will or cunnynge but in ye mercye of god.
045	ROM	009	017	For the scripture sayth vnto Pharao: Even for this same purpose have I stered ye vp to shewe my power on ye and that my name myght be declared thorow out all the worlde.
045	ROM	009	018	So hath he mercye on whom he will and whom he will he maketh hearde herted.
045	ROM	009	019	Thou wilt saye then vnto me: why then blameth he vs yet?  For who can resist his will?
045	ROM	009	020	But o man what arte thou which disputest with God?  Shall the worke saye to the workeman: why hast thou made me on this fassion?
045	ROM	009	021	Hath not the potter power over the claye even of the same lompe to make one vessell vnto honoure and a nother vnto dishonoure?
045	ROM	009	022	Even so God willynge to shewe his wrath and to make his power knowen suffered with longe pacience the vessels of wrath ordeyned to damnacion
045	ROM	009	023	that he myght declare ye ryches of his glory on the vessels of mercye which he had prepayred vnto glorie:
045	ROM	009	024	that is to saye vs which he called not of the Iewes only but also of ye gentyls.
045	ROM	009	025	As he sayth in Osee: I will call them my people which were not my people: and her beloved which was not beloved.
045	ROM	009	026	And it shall come to passe in the place where it was sayd vnto them ye are not my people: that there shalbe called the chyldren of the lyvynge God.
045	ROM	009	027	But Esaias cryeth concernynge Israel though the nomber of the chyldren of Israel be as the sonde of the see yet shall a remnaut be saved.
045	ROM	009	028	He finyssheth the worde verely and maketh it short in ryghtwesses.  For a short worde will god make on erth.
045	ROM	009	029	And as Esaias sayd before: Except the Lorde of sabaoth had left us seede we had bene made as Zodoma and had bene lykened to Gomorra.
045	ROM	009	030	What shall we saye then?  We saye that the gentyls which followed not rightewesnes have overtaken rightewesnes: I meane the rightewesnes which cometh of fayth.
045	ROM	009	031	But Israel which folowed the lawe of rightewesnes coulde not attayne vnto ye lawe of rightewesnes.
045	ROM	009	032	And wherfore?  Because they sought it not by fath: but as it were by the workes of the lawe.  For they have stombled at the stomblynge stone.
045	ROM	009	033	As it is written: Beholde I put in Syon a stomblynge stone and a rocke which shall make men faule.  And none yt beleve on him shalbe a shamed.
045	ROM	010	001	Brethren my hertes desyre and prayer to God for Israel is that they might be saved.
045	ROM	010	002	For I beare them recorde that they have a fervet mynde to God warde but not accordinge to knowledge.
045	ROM	010	003	For they are ignoraut of the rightewesnes which is alowed before God and goo about to stablisshe their awne rightewesnes and therfore are not obedient vnto the rightewesnes which is of valew before God.
045	ROM	010	004	For Christ is the ende of the lawe to iustifie all that beleve.
045	ROM	010	005	Moses describeth the rightewesnes which cometh of ye lawe howe that the man which doth the thinges of the lawe shall lyve therin.
045	ROM	010	006	But ye rightewesnes which cometh of fayth speaketh on this wyse.  Saye not in thyne hert who shall ascende into heven?  (that is nothinge els then to fetch Christ doune)
045	ROM	010	007	Other who shall descende into the depe?  (that is nothinge els but to fetch vp Christ from deeth)
045	ROM	010	008	But what sayth the scripture?  The worde is nye the even in thy mouth and in thyn herte.  This worde is the worde of fayth which we preache.
045	ROM	010	009	For yf thou shalt knowledge wt thy mouth that Iesus is the lorde and shalt beleve with thyn hert that God raysed him up from deeth thou shalt be safe.
045	ROM	010	010	For the belefe of the hert iustifieth: and to knowledge with the mouth maketh a man safe.
045	ROM	010	011	For the scripture sayth: whosoever beleveth on him shall not be ashamed.
045	ROM	010	012	Ther is no difference bitwene the Iewe and the gentyll.  For one is Lorde of all which is ryche vnto all that call on him.
045	ROM	010	013	For whosoever shall call on the name of the lorde shalbe safe.
045	ROM	010	014	But how shall they call on him on who they beleved not?  how shall they beleve on him of whom they have not herde?  how shall they heare with out a preacher?
045	ROM	010	015	And how shall they preach except they be sent?  As it is written: how beautifull are the fete of them which bringe glad tydynges of peace and bringe glad tydynges of good thinges.
045	ROM	010	016	But they have not all obeyed to ye gospell.  For Esaias sayth: Lorde who shall beleve oure sayinges?
045	ROM	010	017	So then fayth cometh by hearynge and hearynge cometh by the worde of God.
045	ROM	010	018	But I axe: have they not herde?  No dout their sounde went out into all londes: and their wordes in to the endes of the worlde.
045	ROM	010	019	But I demaunde whether Israel dyd knowe or not?  Fyrst Moses sayth: I will provoke you for to envy by the that are no people and by a folisshe nacion I will anger you.
045	ROM	010	020	Esaias after that is bolde and sayth.  I am founde of the that sought me not and have appered to them that axed not after me.
045	ROM	010	021	And agaynst Israel he sayth: All daye longe have I stretched forth my hondes vnto a people yt beleveth not but speaketh agaynst me.
045	ROM	011	001	I saye then: hath god cast awaye his people?  God forbyd.  For even I verely am an Israelite of the seed of Abraha and of ye tribe of Beniamin
045	ROM	011	002	god hath not cast awaye his people which he knew before.  Ether wote ye not what the scripture sayth by the mouth of Helias how he maketh intercession to god agaynst Israel sayinge:
045	ROM	011	003	Lorde they have kylled thy prophetes and dygged doune thyn alters: and I am lefte only and they seke my lyfe.
045	ROM	011	004	But what sayth the answer of god to him agayne?  I have reserved vnto me seven thousande men which have not bowed the knee to Baal.
045	ROM	011	005	Even so at this tyme ys ther a remnanaunt lefte thorow the eleccion of grace.
045	ROM	011	006	Yf it be of grace the is it not of workes.  For then were grace no moare grace.  Yf it be of workes then is it no moare grace.  For then were deservyng no lenger deservynge.
045	ROM	011	007	What then?  Israel hath not obtayned that that he sought.  No but yet the election hath obtayned it.  The remnaunt are blynded
045	ROM	011	008	accordynge as it is written: God hath geven the the sprete of vnquyetnes: eyes that they shuld not se and eares that they shuld not heare even vnto this daye.
045	ROM	011	009	And David sayth: Let their table be made a snare to take them with all and an occasion to faule and a rewarde vnto them.
045	ROM	011	010	Let their eyes be blynded that they se not: and ever bowe doune their backes.
045	ROM	011	011	I saye then: Have they therfore stombled that they shulde but faule only?  God forbyd: but thorowe their faule is salvacio happened vnto the gentyls for to provoke the with all.
045	ROM	011	012	Wherfore yf the faule of them be the ryches of the worlde: and the mynysshynge of them the ryches of the gentyls: How moche more shuld it be so yf they all beleved.
045	ROM	011	013	I speake to you gentyls in as moche as I am the Apostle of ye gentyls I will magnify myn office
045	ROM	011	014	that I myght provoke them which are my flesshe and myght save some of them.
045	ROM	011	015	For yf the castynge awaye of them be the reconcylynge of the worlde: what shall the receavynge of them be but lyfe agayne from deeth?
045	ROM	011	016	For yf one pece be holy the whole heepe is holy.  And yf the rote be holy the braunches are holy also.
045	ROM	011	017	Though some of the brauuches be broken of and thou beynge a wylde olyue tree arte graft in amonge them and made parttaker of ye rote and fatnes of the olyve tree
045	ROM	011	018	bost not thy selfe agaynst the brauches.  For yf thou bost thy selfe remember that thou bearest not the rote but the rote the.
045	ROM	011	019	Thou wilt saye then: the brauches are broken of that I myght be grafte in.
045	ROM	011	020	Thou sayest well: because of vnbeleve they are broken of and thou stondest stedfast in fayth.
045	ROM	011	021	Be not hye mynded but feare seynge that God spared not the naturall braunches lest haply he also spare not the.
045	ROM	011	022	Beholde ye kyndnes and rigorousnes of God: on the which fell rigorousnes: but towardes the kyndnes yf thou cotinue in his kyndnes.  Or els thou shalt be hewen of
045	ROM	011	023	and they yf they byde not still in vnbelefe shalbe graffed in agayne.  For God is of power to graffe them in agayne.
045	ROM	011	024	For yf thou wast cut out of a naturall wilde olyve tree and wast graffed contrary to nature in a true olyve tree: how moche more shall the naturall brauches be graffed in their awne olyve tree agayne.
045	ROM	011	025	I wolde not that this secrete shuld be hyd fro you my brethren (lest ye shuld be wyse in youre awne consaytes) that partly blyndnes is happened in Israel vntyll ye fulnes of the gentyls be come in:
045	ROM	011	026	and so all Israel shalbe saved.  As it is writte: There shall come oute of Sion he yt doth delyver and shall turne awaye the vngodlynes of Iacob.
045	ROM	011	027	And this is my covenaunt vnto them when I shall take awaye their synnes.
045	ROM	011	028	As cocernynge the gospell they are enemies for youre sakes: but as touchinge the election they are loved for ye fathers sakes.
045	ROM	011	029	For verely the gyftes and callynge of god are soche that it cannot repent him of them:
045	ROM	011	030	for loke as ye in tyme passed have not beleved God yet have now obtayned mercy thorow their vnbelefe:
045	ROM	011	031	even so now have they not beleved the mercy which is happened vnto you that they also maye obtayne mercy.
045	ROM	011	032	God hath wrapped all nacions in vnbeleve that he myght have mercie on all.
045	ROM	011	033	O the depnes of the aboundaunt wysdome and knowledge of God: how vnserchable are his iudgementes and his wayes past findyng out.
045	ROM	011	034	For who hath knowen the mynde of the lorde?  or who was his counseller?
045	ROM	011	035	other who hath geven vnto him fyrst that he myght be recompensed agayne?
045	ROM	011	036	For of him and thorow him and for him are all thinges To him be glorye for ever Amen.
045	ROM	012	001	I beseche you therfore brethre by ye mercyfulnes of God that ye make youre bodyes aquicke sacrifise holy and acceptable vnto God which is youre resonable seruynge of god.
045	ROM	012	002	And fassion not youre selves lyke vnto this worlde: But be ye chaunged in youre shape by the renuynge of youre wittes that ye maye fele what thynge that good yt acceptable and perfaycte will of god is.
045	ROM	012	003	For I saye (thorowe the grace that vnto me geve is) to every man amonge you that noman esteme of him selfe moare then it becometh him to esteme: but that he discretely iudge of him selfe accordynge as God hath dealte to every man the measure of fayth.
045	ROM	012	004	As we have many members in one body and all members have not one office:
045	ROM	012	005	so we beynge many are one body in Christ and every man (amoge oure selves) one anothers mebers Seynge
045	ROM	012	006	that we have dyvers gyftes accordynge to the grace that is geven vnto vs: yf eny man have ye gyft of prophesye let him have it that it be agreynge vnto the fayth.
045	ROM	012	007	Let him that hath an office wayte on his office.  Let him that teacheth take hede to his doctrine.
045	ROM	012	008	Let him that exhorteth geve attendaunce to his exhortacion.  Yf eny man geve let him do it with singlenes.  Let him that ruleth do it with diligence.  Yf eny man shewe mercy let him do it with cherfulnes.
045	ROM	012	009	Let love be wt out dissimulacion.  Hate that which is evyll and cleave vnto that which is good.
045	ROM	012	010	Be kynde one to another with brotherly love.  In gevynge honoure goo one before another.
045	ROM	012	011	Let not yt busynes which ye have in honde be tedious to you.  Be fervet in ye sprete.  Applye youre selves to ye tyme.
045	ROM	012	012	Reioyce in hope.  Be paciet in tribulacion.  Continue in prayer.
045	ROM	012	013	Distribute vnto the necessite of the saynctes and diligently to harboure.
045	ROM	012	014	Blesse the which persecute you: blesse but course not.
045	ROM	012	015	Be mery with the that are mery.  Wepe wt them that wepe.
045	ROM	012	016	Be of lyke affeccion one towardes another.  Be not hye mided: but make youreselves equall to the of ye lower sorte.  Be not wyse in youre awne opinios.
045	ROM	012	017	Recopence to no ma evyll fore evyll.  Provyde afore honde thinges honest in ye syght of all men.
045	ROM	012	018	Yf it be possible howbe it of youre parte have peace with all men.
045	ROM	012	019	Derly beloued avenge not youre selves but geve roume vnto the wrath of God.  For it is written: vengeaunce is myne and I will rewarde saith the lorde.
045	ROM	012	020	Terfore yf thyn enemy honger fede him: yf he thurst geve him drinke.  For in so doynge thou shalt heape coles of fyre on his heed:
045	ROM	012	021	Be not overcome of evyll: But overcome evyll wt goodnes.
045	ROM	013	001	Let every soule submit him selfe vnto the auctorite of ye hyer powers.  For there is no power but of God.
045	ROM	013	002	The powers that be are ordeyned of God.  Whosoever therfore resysteth power resisteth the ordinaunce of God.  And they that resist shall receave to the selfe damnacio.
045	ROM	013	003	For rulars are not to be feared for good workes but for evyll Wilt thou be with out feare of the power?  Do well then: and so shalt thou be praysed of the same.
045	ROM	013	004	For he is the minister of God for thy welth.  But and yf thou do evyll then feare: for he beareth not a swearde for nought: but is the minister of God to take vengeaunce on them that do evyll.
045	ROM	013	005	Wherfore ye must nedes obeye not for feare of vengeaunce only: but also because of conscience.
045	ROM	013	006	And even for this cause paye ye tribute.  For they are goddes ministers servynge for the same purpose.
045	ROM	013	007	Geve to every man therfore his duetie: Tribute to whom tribute belongeth: Custome to whom custome is due: feare to whom feare belongeth: Honoure to who honoure pertayneth
045	ROM	013	008	Owe nothinge to eny man: but to love one another.  For he that loveth another fulfylleth the lawe.
045	ROM	013	009	For these commaundementes: Thou shalt not comit advoutry: Thou shalt not kyll: Thou shalt not steale: Thou shalt not beare false witnes: Thou shalt not desyre and so forth (yf there be eny other comaundement) they are all comprehended in this sayinge: Love thyne neghbour as thy selfe.
045	ROM	013	010	Love hurteth not his neghbour.  Therfore is love the fulfillynge of the lawe.
045	ROM	013	011	This also we knowe I mean the season howe that it is tyme that we shuld now awake oute of slepe.  For now is oure salvacion nearer then when we beleved.
045	ROM	013	012	The nyght is passed and the daye is come nye.  Let us therfore cast awaye the dedes of darcknes and let vs put on the (Armoure) of lyght.
045	ROM	013	013	Let vs walke honestly as it were in the daye lyght: not in eatynge and drinkynge: nether in chamburynge and wantannes: nether in stryfe and envyinge:
045	ROM	013	014	but put ye on the Lorde Iesus Christ.  And make not provision for the flesshe to fulfyll ye lustes of it.
045	ROM	014	001	Him that is weake in the fayth receave vnto you not in disputynge and troublynge his conscience.
045	ROM	014	002	One beleveth that he maye eate all thinge.  Another which is weake eateth earbes.
045	ROM	014	003	Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not.  And let not him whiche eateth not iudge him that eateth.  For God hath receaved him.
045	ROM	014	004	What arte thou that iudgest another manes servaut?  Whether he stonde or faule that pertayneth vnto his master: ye he shall stonde.  For God is able to make him stonde.
045	ROM	014	005	This man putteth difference bitwene daye and daye.  Another man counteth all dayes alyke.  Se that no man waver in his awne meanynge.
045	ROM	014	006	He that observeth one daye more then another doth it for ye lordes pleasure.  And he that observeth not one daye moare then another doeth it to please ye lorde also.  He that eateth doth it to please the lorde for he geveth god thankes.
045	ROM	014	007	And he yt eateth not eateth not to please ye lorde wt all and geveth god thankes.
045	ROM	014	008	For none of vs lyveth his awne servaut: nether doeth anye of vs dye his awne servaunt.  Yf we lyve we lyve to be at ye lordes will.  And yf we dye we dye at ye lordes will.  Whether we lyve therfore or dye we are the lordes.
045	ROM	014	009	For Christ therfore dyed and rose agayne and revived that he myght be lorde both of deed and quicke.
045	ROM	014	010	But why doest thou then iudge thy brother?  Other why doest thou despyse thy brother?  We shall all be brought before the iudgement seate of Christ.
045	ROM	014	011	For it is written: as truely as I lyve sayth ye lorde all knees shall bowe to me and all tonges shall geve a knowledge to God.
045	ROM	014	012	So shall every one of vs geve accomptes of him selfe to God.
045	ROM	014	013	Let vs not therfore iudge one another eny more.  But iudge this rather that no man put a stomblynge blocke or an occasion to faule in his brothers waye.
045	ROM	014	014	For I knowe and am full certified in the Lorde Iesus that ther is nothinge comen of it selfe: but vnto him that iudgeth it to be comen: to him is it comen.
045	ROM	014	015	If thy brother be greved with thy meate now walkest thou not charitablye.  Destroye not him with thy meate for whom Christ dyed.
045	ROM	014	016	Cause not youre treasure to be evyll spoken of.
045	ROM	014	017	For the kyngdome of God is not meate and drinke: but rightewesnes peace and ioye in the holy goost.
045	ROM	014	018	For whosoever in these thinges serveth Christ pleaseth well God and is commended of men.
045	ROM	014	019	Let vs folowe tho thinges which make for peace and thinges wherwith one maye edyfie another.
045	ROM	014	020	Destroye not ye worke of god for a lytell meates sake.  All thinges are pure: but it is evyll for that man which eateth with hurte of his conscience.
045	ROM	014	021	It is good nether to eate flesshe nether to drincke wyne nether eny thinge wherby thy brother stombleth ether falleth or is made weake.
045	ROM	014	022	Hast thou fayth?  have it with thy selfe before god.  Happy is he yt condempneth not him selfe in that thinge which he aloweth.
045	ROM	014	023	For he yt maketh conscience is dampned yf he eate: because he doth it not of fayth.  For whatsoever is not of fayth that same is synne.
045	ROM	015	001	We which are stronge ought to beare the fraylnes of them which are weake and not to stonde in oure awne cosaytes.
045	ROM	015	002	Let every man please his neghbour vnto his welth and edyfyinge.
045	ROM	015	003	For Christ pleased not him selfe: but as it is written.  The rebukes of the which rebuked the fell one me.

045	ROM	015	008	And I saye that Iesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the trueth of god to conferme the promyses made vnto the fathers.
045	ROM	015	009	And let the gentyls prayse god for his mercy as it is written: For this cause I will prayse the amonge the gentyls and synge in thy name.

046	1CO	001	003	Grace be with you and peace fro God oure father and from the lorde Iesus Christ.
046	1CO	001	004	I thanke my God all wayes on youre behalfe for ye grace of God which is geuen you by Iesus Christ
046	1CO	001	005	that in all thinges ve are made riche by him in all lerninge and in all knowledge
046	1CO	001	006	even as the testimony of Iesus Christ was confermed in you)
046	1CO	001	007	so that ye are behynde in no gyft and wayte for the apperynge of oure lorde Iesus Christ
046	1CO	001	008	which shall streght you vnto ye ende that ye maye be blamelesse in ye daye of oure lorde Iesus Christ.
046	1CO	001	009	ffor god is faythfull by whom ye are called vnto ye fellishyppe of his sonne Iesus Christe oure lorde
046	1CO	001	010	I beseche you brethre in ye name of oure lorde Iesus Christ that ye all speake one thynge and that there be no dissencion amoge you: but be ye knyt together in one mynde and in one meaynge.
046	1CO	001	011	It is shewed vnto me (my brethren) of you by them that are of the housse of Cloe that ther is stryfe amonge you.  And this is it that I meane:
046	1CO	001	012	how that comelie amonge you one sayeth: I holde of Paul: another I holde of Apollo: ye thyrde I holde of Cephas: ye four ye I holde of Christ.
046	1CO	001	013	Ys Christ devided?  was Paul crucified for you?  ether were ye baptised in ye name of Paul?
046	1CO	001	014	I thanke God that I christened none of you but Crispus and Gayus
046	1CO	001	015	lest eny shulde saye that I had baptised in myne awne name.
046	1CO	001	016	I baptised also the housse of Stephana.  Forthermore knowe I not whether I baptised eny man or no.
046	1CO	001	017	For Christ sent me not to baptyse but to preache ye gospell not with wysdome of wordes lest the crosse of Christ shuld have bene made of none effecte.
046	1CO	001	018	For ye preachinge of the crosse is to them yt perisshe folishnes: but vnto vs which are saved it is ye power of God.
046	1CO	001	019	For it is written: I will destroye the wysdome of the wyse and will cast awaye the vnderstondinge of the prudet.
046	1CO	001	020	Where is the wyse?  Where is the scrybe?  Where is the searcher of this worlde?  Hath not God made the wysdome of this worlde folisshnes?
046	1CO	001	021	For when the worlde thorow wysdome knew not God in ye wysdome of God: it pleased God thorow folisshnes of preachinge to save them yt beleve.
046	1CO	001	022	For ye Iewes requyre a signe and the Grekes seke after wysdome.
046	1CO	001	023	But we preache Christ crucified vnto the Iewes an occasion of fallinge and vnto the Grekes folisshnes:
046	1CO	001	024	but vnto the which are called both of Iewes and Grekes we preache Christ ye power of God and the wysdome of God.
046	1CO	001	025	For the folishnes of God is wyser then me: and the weakenes of God is stronger then men.
046	1CO	001	026	Brethren loke on youre callinge how that not many wyse men after the flesshe not many myghty not many of hye degre are called:
046	1CO	001	027	but God hath chosen the folysshe thinges of the worlde to confounde the wyse.  And God hath chosyn the weake thinges of the worlde to confounde thinges which are mighty.
046	1CO	001	028	And vile thinges of the worlde and thinges which are despysed hath God chosen yee and thinges of no reputacion for to brynge to nought thinges of reputacion
046	1CO	001	029	that no flesshe shulde reioyce in his presence.
046	1CO	001	030	And vnto him partayne ye in Christ Iesu which of God is made vnto vs wysdome and also rightewesnes and saunctifyinge and redempcion.
046	1CO	001	031	That accordinge as it is written: he which reioyseth shulde reioyce in the Lorde.
046	1CO	002	001	And I brethren when I came to you came not in gloriousnes of wordes or of wysdome shewynge vnto you the testimony of God.
046	1CO	002	002	Nether shewed I my selfe that I knewe eny thinge amonge you save Iesus Christ eve the same that was crucified.
046	1CO	002	003	And I was amoge you in weaknes and in feare and in moche treblinge.
046	1CO	002	004	And my wordes and my preachinge were not with entysynge wordes of manes wysdome: but in shewinge of ye sprete and of power
046	1CO	002	005	that youre fayth shuld not stonde in ye wysdome of me but in yt power of God.
046	1CO	002	006	That we speake of is wysdome amonge them that are perfecte: not the wysdome of this worlde nether of the rulars of this worlde (which go to nought)
046	1CO	002	007	but we speake ye wysdome of God which is in secrete and lieth hyd which God ordeyned before the worlde vnto oure glory:
046	1CO	002	008	which wysdome none of ye rulars of the worlde knewe.  For had they knowe it they wolde not have crucified the Lorde of glory.
046	1CO	002	009	But as it is written: The eye hath not sene and the eare hath not hearde nether have entred into the herte of man ye thinges which God hath prepared for them that love him.
046	1CO	002	010	But God hath opened them vnto vs by his sprete.  For ye sprete searcheth all thinges ye the bottome of Goddes secretes.
046	1CO	002	011	For what man knoweth the thinges of a ma: save ye sprete of a man which is with in him?  Even so ye thinges of God knoweth no man but ye sprete of god.
046	1CO	002	012	And we have not receaved the sprete of ye worlde: but the sprete which cometh of god for to knowe the thinges that are geve to vs of god
046	1CO	002	013	which thinges also we speake not in the conynge wordes of manes wysdome but with the conynge wordes of the holy goost makynge spretuall coparesons of spretuall thinges.
046	1CO	002	014	For ye naturall man perceaveth not the thinges of the sprete of god.  For they are but folysshnes vnto him.  Nether can he perceave them because he is spretually examined.
046	1CO	002	015	But he that is spretuall discusseth all thinges: yet he him selfe is iudged of no ma.
046	1CO	002	016	For who knoweth the mynde of the Lorde other who shall informe him?  But we vnderstonde the mynde of Christ.
046	1CO	003	001	And I coulde not speake vnto you brethre as vnto spretuall: but as vnto carnall even as it were vnto babes in Christ.
046	1CO	003	002	I gave you mylke to drinke and not meate.  For ye then were not stronge no nether yet are.
046	1CO	003	003	For ye are yet carnall.  As longe verely as ther is amoge you envyige stryfe and dissencio: are ye not carnall and walke after ye manner of me?
046	1CO	003	004	As loge as one sayth I holde of Paul and another I am of Apollo are ye not carnall?
046	1CO	003	005	What is Paul?  What thinge is Apollo?  Only miministers are they by who ye beleved even as the Lorde gave every ma grace.
046	1CO	003	006	I have planted: Apollo watred: but god gave increace.
046	1CO	003	007	So then nether is he that planteth eny thinge nether he yt watreth: but god which gave the increace.
046	1CO	003	008	He that planteth and he that watreth are nether better then the other.  Every man yet shall receave his rewarde accordynge to his laboure.
046	1CO	003	009	We are goddis labourers ye are goddis husbandrye ye are goddis byldynge.
046	1CO	003	010	Accordynge to the grace of god geven vnto me as a wyse bylder have I layde the foundacio And another bylt thero But let every ma take hede how he bildeth apo.
046	1CO	003	011	For other foundacion can no man laye then yt which is layde which is Iesus Christ.
046	1CO	003	012	Yf eny man bilde on this foundacion golde silver precious stones tymber haye or stoble:
046	1CO	003	013	every mannes worke shall appere.  For the daye shall declare it and it shalbe shewed in fyre.  And ye fyre shall trye euery mannes worke what it is.
046	1CO	003	014	Yf eny mannes worke yt he hath bylt apon byde he shall receave a rewarde.
046	1CO	003	015	If eny manes worke burne he shall suffre losse: but he shalbe safe him selfe: neverthelesse yet as it were thorow fyre.
046	1CO	003	016	Are ye not ware that ye are the temple of god and how that the sprete of god dwelleth in you?
046	1CO	003	017	Yf eny man defyle the temple of god him shall god destroye.  For the temple of god is holy which temple ye are.
046	1CO	003	018	Let no man deceave him silfe.  Yf eny man seme wyse amonge you let him be a fole in this worlde that he maye be wyse.
046	1CO	003	019	For ye wisdome of this worlde is folysshnes with god.  For it is writte: he compaseth the wyse in their craftynes.
046	1CO	003	020	And agayne God knoweth the thoughtes of the wyse that they be vayne.
046	1CO	003	021	Therfore let no ma reioyce in men.  For all thinges are youres
046	1CO	003	022	whether it be Paul other Apollo other Cephas: whether it be ye worlde other lyfe other deeth whether they be present thinges or thinges to come: all are youres
046	1CO	003	023	and ye are Christes and Christ is goddis.
046	1CO	004	001	Let men this wyse esteme vs eve as the ministers of Christ and disposers of ye secretes of God.
046	1CO	004	002	Furthermore it is requyred of the disposers that they be founde faithfull.
046	1CO	004	003	With me is it but a very smal thinge that I shuld be iudged of you ether of (mans daye) No I iudge not myn awne selfe.
046	1CO	004	004	I know nought by my selfe: yet am I not therby iustified.  It is the Lorde that iudgeth me.
046	1CO	004	005	Therfore iudge no thinge before the tyme vntill the Lorde come which will lighten thinges that are hyd in darcknes and ope the counsels of the hertes.  And then shall every man have prayse of God.
046	1CO	004	006	These thinges brethre I have described in myn awne person and Apollos for youre sakes that ye myght learne by vs that no man coute of him selfe beyonde that which is above written: that one swell not agaynst another for eny mans cause.
046	1CO	004	007	For who preferreth the?  What hast thou that thou hast not receaved?  Yf thou have receaved it why reioysest thou as though thou haddest not receaved it?
046	1CO	004	008	Now ye are full: now ye are made rych: ye raygne as kinges with out vs: and I wold to god ye dyd raygne that we might raygne with you.
046	1CO	004	009	Me thinketh that God hath set forth vs which are Apostles for the lowest of all as it were me appoynted to deeth.  For we are a gasyngestocke vnto the worlde and to ye angels and to men.
046	1CO	004	010	We are foles for Christes sake and ye are wyse thorow Christ.  We are weake and ye are stroge.  Ye are honorable and we are despised.
046	1CO	004	011	Eve vnto this daye we honger and thyrst and are naked and are boffetted wt fistes and have no certayne dwellinge place
046	1CO	004	012	and laboure workinge with oure awne hondes.  We are revysed and yet we blesse.  We are persecuted and suffer it.
046	1CO	004	013	We are evyll spoken of and we praye.  We are made as it were the filthynes of the worlde the ofscowringe of all thinges even vnto this tyme.
046	1CO	004	014	I write not these thinges to shame you: but as my beloved sonnes I warne you.
046	1CO	004	015	For though ye have ten thousande instructours in Christ: yet have ye not many fathers.  In Christ Iesu I have begotten you thorowe ye gospell.
046	1CO	004	016	Wherfore I desyre you to folowe me.
046	1CO	004	017	For this cause have I sent vnto you Timotheus which is my deare sonne and faithfull in the Lorde which shall put you in remembrauce of my wayes which I have in Christ eve as I teache every where in all congregacios.
046	1CO	004	018	Some swell as though I wolde come no more at you.
046	1CO	004	019	But I will come to you shortely yf God will: and will knowe not ye wordes of the which swell but ye power:
046	1CO	004	020	for ye kyngdome of God is not in wordes but in power.
046	1CO	004	021	What will ye?  Shall I come vnto you with a rodde or els in love and in the sprete of mekenes?
046	1CO	005	001	There goeth a comen sayinge that ther is fornicacion amoge you and soche fornicacion as is not once named amonge the gentyls: that one shuld have his fathers wyfe.
046	1CO	005	002	And ye swell and have not rather sorowed yt he which hath done this dede myght be put fro amoge you.
046	1CO	005	003	For I verely as absent in body even so present in sprete have determyned all redy (as though I were present) of him that hath done this dede
046	1CO	005	004	in the name of oure Lorde Iesu Christ when ye are gaddered togedder and my sprete with the power of the Lorde Iesus Christ
046	1CO	005	005	to deliver him vnto Satan for ye destruccio of the flesshe yt the sprete maye be saved in ye daye of ye Lorde Iesus.
046	1CO	005	006	Youre reioysinge is not good: knowe ye not that a lytle leve sowreth the whole lompe of dowe.
046	1CO	005	007	Pourge therfore the olde leven that ye maye be newe dowe as ye are swete breed.  For Christ oure esterlambe is offered vp for vs.
046	1CO	005	008	Therfore let vs kepe holy daye not with olde leve nether with the leven of maliciousnes and wickednes: but with the swete breed of purenes and truth.
046	1CO	005	009	I wrote vnto you in a pistle that ye shuld not company with fornicatours.
046	1CO	005	010	And I meat not at all of the fornicatours of this worlde ether of the coveteous or of extorsioners ether of the ydolaters: for then must ye nedes have gone out of ye worlde.
046	1CO	005	011	But now I write vnto you that ye company not togedder yf eny that is called a brother be a fornicator or coveteous or a worshipper of ymages ether a raylar ether a dronkard or an extorcionar: with him that is soche se that ye eate not.
046	1CO	005	012	For what have I to do to iudge them which are with out?  Do ye not iudge them that are with in?
046	1CO	005	013	Them that are with out God shall iudge.  Put awaye from amonge you that evyll parson.
046	1CO	006	001	How dare one of you havinge busines with another goo to lawe vnder the wicked and not rather vnder the sainctes?
046	1CO	006	002	Do ye not know that the sainctes shall iudge the worlde?  If the worlde shalbe iudged by you: are ye not good ynough to iudge smale trifles:
046	1CO	006	003	knowe ye not how that we shall iudge the angles?  How moche more maye we iudge thinges that partayne to ye lyfe?
046	1CO	006	004	If ye have iudgementes of worldely matters take them which are despised in ye congregacio and make them iudges.
046	1CO	006	005	This I saye to youre shame.  Is ther vtterly no wyse man amoge you?  What not one at all yt can iudge bitwene brother and brother
046	1CO	006	006	but one brother goeth to lawe with another: and that vnder the vnbelevers?
046	1CO	006	007	Now therfore ther is vtterly a faute amonge you because ye goo to lawe one with another.  Why rather suffer ye not wronge?  why rather suffre ye not youre selves to be robbed?
046	1CO	006	008	Naye ye youre selves do wronge and robbe: and that the brethren.
046	1CO	006	009	Do ye not remember how that the vnrighteous shall not inheret the kyngdome of God?  Be not deceaved.  For nether fornicators nether worshyppers of ymages nether whormongers nether weaklinges nether abusars of them selves with the mankynde
046	1CO	006	010	nether theves nether the coveteous nether dronkardes nether cursed speakers nether pillers shall inheret the kyngdome of God.
046	1CO	006	011	And soche ware ye verely: but ye are wesshed: ye are sanctified: ye are iustified by the name of the Lorde Iesus and by the sprete of oure God.
046	1CO	006	012	All thinges are lawfull vnto me: but all thinges are not proffitable.  I maye do all thinges: but I will be brought vnder no mans power.
046	1CO	006	013	Meates are ordeyned for the belly and the belly for meates: but God shall destroy bothe it and them.  Let not the body be applied vnto fornicacion but vnto the Lorde and the Lorde vnto the body.
046	1CO	006	014	God hath raysed vp the Lorde and shall rayse vs vp by his power.
046	1CO	006	015	Ether remember ye not that youre bodyes are the members of Christ?  Shall I now take the members of Christ and make them the members of an harlot?  God forbyd.
046	1CO	006	016	Do ye not vnderstonde that he which coupleth him selfe with an harlot is become one body?  For two (saith he) shalbe one flesshe.
046	1CO	006	017	But he that is ioyned vnto the Lorde is one sprete.
046	1CO	006	018	Fle fornicacion.  All synnes that a man dothe are with out ye body.  But he yt is a fornicator synneth agaynst his awne body.
046	1CO	006	019	Ether knowe ye not how that youre bodyes are the temple of ye holy goost which is in you who ye have of God and how that ye are not youre awne?
046	1CO	006	020	For ye are dearly bought.  Therfore glorifie ye God in youre bodyes and in youre spretes for they are goddes.
046	1CO	007	001	As concerninge the thinges wherof ye wrote vnto me: it is good for a ma not to touche a woman.
046	1CO	007	002	Neverthelesse to avoyde fornicacio let every man have his wyfe: and let every woman have her husbande.
046	1CO	007	003	Let the man geve vnto the wyfe due benevolence.  Lykwyse also the wyfe vnto the man.
046	1CO	007	004	The wyfe hath not power over her awne body: but the husbande.  And lykewyse the man hath not power over his awne body: but the wyfe
046	1CO	007	005	Withdrawe not youre selves one from another excepte it be with consent for a tyme for to geve youre selves to fastynge and prayer.  And afterwarde come agayne to the same thynge lest Satan tempt you for youre incontinencye.
046	1CO	007	006	This I saye of faveour not of comaundement.
046	1CO	007	007	For I wolde that all men were as I my selfe am: but every man hath his proper gyfte of God one after this maner another after that.
046	1CO	007	008	I saye vnto the vnmaried men and widdowes: it is good for them yf they abyde eve as I do.
046	1CO	007	009	But and yf they canot abstayne let them mary.  For it is better to mary then to burne.
046	1CO	007	010	Vnto the maryed comaunde not I but the Lorde: that the wyfe separate not her selfe from the man.
046	1CO	007	011	Yf she separate her selfe let her remayne vnmaryed or be reconciled vnto her husbande agayne.  And let not the husbande put awaye his wyfe from him.
046	1CO	007	012	To the remnaunt speake I and not the lorde.  Yf eny brother have a wyfe that beleveth not yf she be content to dwell with him let him not put her awaye.
046	1CO	007	013	And ye woma which hath to her husbande an infidell yf he consent to dwell with her let her not put him awaye.
046	1CO	007	014	For ye vnbelevynge husbande is sanctified by the wyfe: and the vnbelevynge wyfe is sanctified by the husbande.  Or els were youre chyldren vnclene: but now are they pure.
046	1CO	007	015	But and yf the vnbelevynge departe let him departe.  A brother or a sister is not in subiection to soche.  God hath called vs in peace.
046	1CO	007	016	For how knowest thou o woman whether thou shalt save that man or no?  Other how knowest thou o man whether thou shalt save that woman or no?
046	1CO	007	017	but even as God hath distributed to every man.  As the lorde hath called every person so let him walke: and so orden I in all congregacios.
046	1CO	007	018	Yf eny man be called beynge circumcised let him adde nothinge therto.  Yf eny be called vncircumcised: let him not be circucised.
046	1CO	007	019	Circumcision is nothinge vncircumcision is nothinge: but the kepyng of the comaundmentes of god is altogether.
046	1CO	007	020	Let every man abyde in the same state wherin he was called.
046	1CO	007	021	Arte thou called a servaut?  care not for it.  Neverthelesse yf thou mayst be fre vse it rather.
046	1CO	007	022	For he that is called in the lorde beynge a servaunt is the lordes freman.  Lykwyse he that is called beynge fre is Christes servaut.
046	1CO	007	023	Ye are dearly bought be not mennes seruauntes.
046	1CO	007	024	Brethren let everye man wherin he is called therin abyde with God.
046	1CO	007	025	As concernynge virgins I have no comaundment of the lorde: yet geve I counsell as one that hath obtayned mercye of the lorde to be faythfull.
046	1CO	007	026	I suppose that it is good for the present necessite.  For it is good for a ma so to be.
046	1CO	007	027	Arte thou bounde vnto a wyfe?  seke not to be lowsed.  Arte thou lowsed from a wyfe?  seke not a wyfe.
046	1CO	007	028	But and yf thou take a wyfe thou synnest not.  Lykwyse if a virgin mary she synneth not.  Neverthelesse soche shall have trouble in their flesshe: but I faver you.
046	1CO	007	029	This saye I brethre the tyme is shorte.  It remayneth that they which have wives be as though they had none
046	1CO	007	030	and they that wepe be as though thy wept not: and they that reioyce be as though they reioysed not: and they that bye be as though they possessed not:
046	1CO	007	031	and they yt vse this worlde be as though they vsed it not.  For the fassion of this worlde goeth awaye.
046	1CO	007	032	I wolde have you without care: the single man careth for the thinges of the lorde how he maye please the lorde.
046	1CO	007	033	But he that hath maried careth for the thinges of the worlde howe he maye please his wyfe.
046	1CO	007	034	There is differece bitwene a virgin and a wyfe.  The single woman careth for the thinges of the lorde that she maye be pure both in body and also in sprete But she that is maryed careth for the thinges of the worlde how she maye please her husband.
046	1CO	007	035	This speake I for youre proffit not to tangle you in a snare: but for that which is honest and comly vnto you and that ye maye quyetly cleave vnto the lorde wt out separacion.
046	1CO	007	036	If eny man thinke that it is vncomly for his virgin if she passe the tyme of mariage ad if so nede requyre let him do what he listeth he synneth not: let the be coupled in mariage.
046	1CO	007	037	Neverthelesse he yt purposeth surely in his herte havynge none nede: but hath power over his awne will: and hath so decreed in his herte that he will kepe his virgin doth well.
046	1CO	007	038	So then he that ioyneth his virgin in maryage doth well.  But he that ioyneth not his virgin in mariage doth better.
046	1CO	007	039	The wyfe is bounde to the lawe as longe as her husband liveth If her husbande slepe she is at liberte to mary with whom she wyll only in the lorde.
046	1CO	007	040	But she is happiar yf she so abyde in my iudgmet And I thinke verely that I have the sprete of God.
046	1CO	008	001	To speake of thinges dedicate vnto ydols we are sure that we all have knowledge.  knowledge maketh a man swell: bnt love edifieth.
046	1CO	008	002	If eny man thinke that he knoweth eny thinge he knoweth nothynge yet as he ought to knowe.
046	1CO	008	003	But yf eny man love god the same is knowen of him.
046	1CO	008	004	To speake of meate dedicat vnto ydols we are sure that ther is none ydoll in the worlde and that ther is none other god but one.
046	1CO	008	005	And though ther be yt are called goddes whether in heven other in erth (as ther be goddes many and lordes many)
046	1CO	008	006	yet vnto vs is there but one god which is the father of whom are all thinges and we in him: and one lorde Iesus Christ by whom are all thinges and we by him.
046	1CO	008	007	But every man hath not knowledge.  For some suppose that ther is an ydoll vntyll this houre and eate as of a thinge offered vnto ye ydole and so their consciences beynge yet weake are defyled.
046	1CO	008	008	Meate maketh vs not acceptable to god.  Nether yf we eate are we ye better.  Nether yf we eate not are we the worsse.
046	1CO	008	009	But take hede that youre libertie cause not ye weake to faule.
046	1CO	008	010	For yf some man se ye which hast knowledge sit at meate in the ydoles teple shall not the conscience of hym which is weake be boldened to eate those thinges which are offered vnto ye ydole?
046	1CO	008	011	And so thorow thy knowledge shall ye weake brother perisshe for whom christ dyed.
046	1CO	008	012	Whe ye synne so agaynst the brethren and wounde their weake consciences ye synne agaynst Christ.
046	1CO	008	013	Wherfore yf meate hurt my brother I will eate no flesshe whill the worlde stondeth because I will not hurte my brother.
046	1CO	009	001	Am I not an Apostle?  am I not fre?  have I not sene Iesus Christ oure lorde?
046	1CO	009	002	Are not ye my worke in the lorde.  Yf I be not an Apostle vnto other yet am I vnto you.  For the seale of myne Apostleshippe are ye in the lorde.
046	1CO	009	003	Myne answer to them that axe me is this.
046	1CO	009	004	Have we not power to eate and to drynke?
046	1CO	009	005	Ether have we not power to leade about a sister to wyfe as wel as other Apostles and as the brethren of the lorde and Cephas?
046	1CO	009	006	Ether only I and Barnabas have not power this to do?
046	1CO	009	007	who goeth a warfare eny tyme at his awne cost?  who planteth a vynearde and eateth not of the frute?  Who fedeth a flocke and eateth not of the mylke?
046	1CO	009	008	Saye I these thinges after the manner of men?  Or sayth not the lawe the same also?
046	1CO	009	009	For it ys written in the lawe of Moses.  Thou shall not mosell the mouth of the oxe that treadeth out the corne.  Doth God take thought for oxen?
046	1CO	009	010	Ether sayth he it not all to gedder for oure sakes?  For oure sakes no doute this is written: that he which eareth shuld eare in hope: and that he which thressheth in hope shuld be parttaker of his hope.
046	1CO	009	011	Yf we sowe vnto you spirituall thynges: is it a greate thynge yf we reepe youre carnall thynges
046	1CO	009	012	Yf other be parttakers of this power over you?  wherfore are not we rather.  Neverthelesse we have not vsed this power: but suffre all thinges lest we shuld hynder the gospell of Christ.
046	1CO	009	013	Do ye not vnderstoder how that they which minister in the temple have their fyndynge of the temple?  And they which wayte at the aulter are partakers with ye aultre?
046	1CO	009	014	Even so also dyd ye lorde ordayne that they which preache ye gospell shuld live of the gospell.
046	1CO	009	015	But I have vsed none of these thinges.  Nether wrote I these thinges that it shuld be so done vnto me.  For it were better for me to dye the yt eny man shnld take this reioysinge from me
046	1CO	009	016	In that I preache the gospell I have nothinge to reioyce of.  For necessite is put vnto me.  Wo is it vnto me yf I preache not the gospell.
046	1CO	009	017	If I do it with a good will I have a rewarde.  But yf I do it agaynst my will an office is committed vnto me.
046	1CO	009	018	What is my rewarde then?  Verely that whe I preache the gospell I make the gospell of Christ fre yt I misvse not myne auctorite in ye gospel
046	1CO	009	019	For though I be fre from all men yet have I made my silfe servaunt vnto all men that I myght wynne the moo.
046	1CO	009	020	Vnto the Iewes I became as a Iewe to winne ye Iewes.  To the that were vnder the lawe was I made as though I had bene vnder the lawe to wynne the that were vnder the lawe.
046	1CO	009	021	To them that were without lawe be ca I as though I had bene without lawe (whe I was not without lawe as perteyninge to god but vnder a lawe as concerninge Christ) to wynne the that were without lawe.
046	1CO	009	022	To the weake became I as weake to wynne the weake.  In all thinge I fassioned my silfe to all men to save at ye lest waye some.
046	1CO	009	023	And this I do for the gospels sake that I might have my parte therof.
046	1CO	009	024	Perceave ye not how that they which runne in a course runne all yet but one receaveth the rewarde.  So runne that ye maye obtayne.
046	1CO	009	025	Euery man yt proveth masteryes abstaineth from all thinges.  And they do it to obtayne a corruptible croune: but we to obtayne an vncorruptible croune:
046	1CO	009	026	I therfore so runne not as at an vncertayne thinge.  So fyght I not as one yt beateth the ayer:
046	1CO	009	027	but I tame my body and bringe it into subieccio lest after that I have preached to other I my silfe shuld be a castawaye.
046	1CO	010	001	Brethren I wolde not that ye shuld be ignoraunt of this how yt oure fathers were all vnder a cloude and all passed thorow the see
046	1CO	010	002	and were all baptised vnder Moses in the cloude and in the see:
046	1CO	010	003	and dyd all eate of one spirituall meate
046	1CO	010	004	and did all drincke of one maner of spirituall drincke.  And they dranke of that spretuall rocke that folowed them which rocke was Christ.
046	1CO	010	005	But in many of them had god no delite.  For they were overthrowen in the wildernes.
046	1CO	010	006	These are ensamples to vs that we shuld not lust after evyll thinges as they lusted
046	1CO	010	007	Nether be ye worshippers of Images as were some of them accordynge as it is written: The people sate doune to eate and drynke and rose vp agayne to playe.
046	1CO	010	008	Nether let vs comit fornicacion as some of them committed fornicacion and were destroyed in one daye. xxiii.  thousande.
046	1CO	010	009	Nether let vs tempte Christ as some of them tempted and were destroyed of serpentes.
046	1CO	010	010	Nether murmure ye as some of them murmured and were destroyed of ye destroyer
046	1CO	010	011	All these thinges happened vnto them for ensamples and were written to put vs in remembraunce whom the endes of the worlde are come apon.
046	1CO	010	012	Wherfore let hym that thynketh he stodeth take hede least he fall.
046	1CO	010	013	There hath none other temptacion taken you but soche as foloweth ye nature of ma.  But God is faythfull which shall not suffer you to be tempted above youre strenght: but shall in the myddes of the temptacion make awaye to escape out.
046	1CO	010	014	Wherfore my deare beloued fle from worshippynge of ydols.
046	1CO	010	015	I speake as vnto them which have discrecion Iudge ye what I saye.
046	1CO	010	016	Ys not the cuppe of blessinge which we blesse partakynge of ye bloude of Christ?  ys not the breed which we breake partetakynge of the body of Christ?
046	1CO	010	017	because that we (though we be many) yet are one breed and one bodye in as moch as we all are partetakers of one breed.
046	1CO	010	018	Beholde Israhell which walketh carnally.  Are not they which eate of the sacrifyse partetakers of the aultre?
046	1CO	010	019	What saye I then?  that the ymage is eny thinge?  or that it which is offered to ymages is eny thinge?
046	1CO	010	020	Nay but I saye that those thinges which the gentyle offer they offer to devyls and not to god.  And I wolde not that ye shuld have fellishippe with ye devils
046	1CO	010	021	Ye canot drincke of the cup of the lorde and of yt cup of ye deuyls.  Ye cnanot be partetakers of the lordes table and of the table of deuelles.
046	1CO	010	022	Ether shall we provoke the lorde?  Or are we stronger then he?  All thynges are laufull vnto me but all thynges are not expedient.
046	1CO	010	023	All thynges are lawfull to me but all thinges edifye not.
046	1CO	010	024	Let no man seke his awne proffet: but let every man seke anothers welthe.
046	1CO	010	025	What soever is solde in the market that eate and axe no questions for conscience sake
046	1CO	010	026	For the erth is the lordis and all that therein is.
046	1CO	010	027	Yf eny of them which beleve not bid you to a feest and yf ye be disposed to goo what soever is seet before you: eate axinge no question for conscience sake.
046	1CO	010	028	But and yf eny man saye vnto you: this is dedicate vnto ydols eate not of it for his sake that shewed it and for hurtynge of conscience.
046	1CO	010	029	Conscience I saye not thyne: but the coscieuce of that other.  For why shuld my liberte be iudged of another manes conscience:
046	1CO	010	030	For yf I take my parte with thakes: why am I evell spoken of for that thynge wherfore I geve thankes.
046	1CO	010	031	Whether therfore ye eate or dryncke or what soever ye do do all to the prayse of God.
046	1CO	010	032	Se that ye geve occasion of evell nether to ye Iewes nor yet to the gentyls nether to ye cogregacion of god:
046	1CO	010	033	euen as I please all men in all thinges not sekynge myne awne proffet but the proffet of many that they myght be saved.  Folowe me as I do Christ.
046	1CO	011	001	I commende you
046	1CO	011	002	brethren that ye remeber me in all thinges and kepe the ordinaunces even as I delyvered them to you.
046	1CO	011	003	I wolde ye knew that Christ is the heed of every man.  And the man is the womans heed.  And God is Christes heed.
046	1CO	011	004	Eevery ma prayinge or prophesyinge havynge eny thynge on his heed shameth his heed.
046	1CO	011	005	Every woman that prayeth or prophisieth bare hedded dishonesteth hyr heed.  For it is even all one and the very same thinge even as though she were shaven.
046	1CO	011	006	If the woman be not covered lett her also be shoren.  If it be shame for a woma to be shorne or shave let her cover her heed.
046	1CO	011	007	A man ought not to cover his heed for as moche as he is the image and glory of God.  The woman is the glory of the man.
046	1CO	011	008	For the man is not of the woman but the woman of the ma.
046	1CO	011	009	Nether was the man created for ye womas sake: but the woma for the mannes sake
046	1CO	011	010	For this cause ought the woma to have power on her heed for the angels sakes.
046	1CO	011	011	Neverthelesse nether is the ma with oute the woma nether the woma with out the man in the lorde.
046	1CO	011	012	For as the woman is of the man eve so is the man by the woman: but all is of God.
046	1CO	011	013	Iudge in youre selves whether it be coly yt a woman praye vnto god bare heeded.
046	1CO	011	014	Or els doth not nature teach you that it is a shame for a man
046	1CO	011	015	if he have longe heere: and a prayse to a woman yf she have longe heere?  For her heere is geven her to cover her with all.
046	1CO	011	016	If there be eny man amonge you yt lusteth to stryve let him knowe that we have no soche custome nether the congregacions of God.
046	1CO	011	017	This I warne you of and commende not that ye come to gedder: not after a better maner but after a worsse.
046	1CO	011	018	Fyrst of all when ye come togedder in the cogregacion I heare that ther is dissencion amonge you: and I partly beleve it.
046	1CO	011	019	For ther must be sectes amonge you that they which are perfecte amonge you myght be knowen.
046	1CO	011	020	When ye come to gedder a man cannot eate the lordes supper.  For every man begynneth a fore to eate his awne supper.
046	1CO	011	021	And one is hongrye and another is dronken.  Have ye not houses to eate and to drinke in?
046	1CO	011	022	Or els despyse ye the congregacion of god and shame them that have not?  What shall I saye vnto you?  shall I prayse you: In this prayse I you not.
046	1CO	011	023	That which I delyvered vnto you I receaved of ye lorde.  For ye lorde Iesus the same nyght in which he was betrayed toke breed:
046	1CO	011	024	and thanked and brake and sayde.  Take ye and eate ye: this is my body which is broken for you.  This do ye in the remembraunce of me.
046	1CO	011	025	After the same maner he toke the cup when sopper was done sayinge.  This cup is the newe testament in my bloude.  This do as oft as ye drynke it in the remebraunce of me.
046	1CO	011	026	For as often as ye shall eate this breed and drynke this cup ye shall shewe the lordes deeth tyll he come.
046	1CO	011	027	Wherfore whosoevere shall eate of this bred or drynke of the cup vnworthely shalbe giltie of the body and bloud of the Lorde
046	1CO	011	028	Let a ma therfore examen him silfe and so let hi eate of the breed and drynke of the cup.
046	1CO	011	029	For he yt eateth or drinketh vnworthely eateth and drynketh his awne damnacion because he maketh no difference of the lordis body.
046	1CO	011	030	For this cause many are weake and sicke amoge you and many slepe.
046	1CO	011	031	Yf we had truly iudged oure selves we shuld not have bene iudged.
046	1CO	011	032	But when we are iudged of the lorde we are chastened because we shuld not be daned with the worlde.
046	1CO	011	033	Wherfore my brethren when ye come to gedder to eate tary one for another.
046	1CO	011	034	Yf eny ma hoger let hi eate at home yt ye come not togedder vnto condenacio.  Other thinges will I set in order whe I come.
046	1CO	012	001	In spirituall thinges brethren I wolde not have you ignoraunt.
046	1CO	012	002	Ye knowe that ye were gentyls and went youre wayes vnto domme ydoles even as ye were ledde.
046	1CO	012	003	Wherfore I declare vnto you that no man speakynge in the sprete of god defieth Iesus.  Also no man can saye that Iesus is the lorde: but by the holy goost.
046	1CO	012	004	Ther are diversities of gyftes verely yet but one sprete.
046	1CO	012	005	And ther are differences of administracions and yet but one lorde.
046	1CO	012	006	And ther are divers maners of operacions and yet but one God which worketh all thinges that are wrought in all creatures.
046	1CO	012	007	The gyftes of ye sprete are geven to every man to proffit ye congregacion.
046	1CO	012	008	To one is geven thorow the spirite the vtteraunce of wisdome?  To another is geven the vtteraunce of knowledge by ye same sprete.
046	1CO	012	009	To another is geuen fayth by ye same sprete.  To another ye gyftes of healynge by the same sprete.
046	1CO	012	010	To another power to do myracles.  To another prophesie?  To another iudgement of spretes.  To another divers tonges.  To another the interpretacion of toges.
046	1CO	012	011	And these all worketh eve ye silfe same sprete devydynge to every man severall gyftes even as he will.
046	1CO	012	012	For as the body is one and hath many mebres and all the membres of one body though they be many yet are but one body: even so is Christ.
046	1CO	012	013	For in one sprete are we all baptysed to make one body whether we be Iewes or getyls whether we be bonde or fre: and have all dronke of one sprete.
046	1CO	012	014	For the body is not one member but many.
046	1CO	012	015	Yf the fote saye: I am not the honde therfore I am not of the body: is he therfore not of ye body:
046	1CO	012	016	And if ye eare saye I am not the eye: therfore I am not of the body: is he therfore not of the body?
046	1CO	012	017	If all the body were an eye where were then the eare?  If all were hearynge: where were the smellynge?
046	1CO	012	018	But now hath god disposed the membres every one of them in the body at his awne pleasure.
046	1CO	012	019	If they were all one member: where were the body?
046	1CO	012	020	Now are ther many membres yet but one body.
046	1CO	012	021	And the eye can not saye vnto the honde I have no nede of the: nor ye heed also to the fete.  I have no nede of you.
046	1CO	012	022	Ye rather a greate deale those mebres of the body which seme to be most feble are most necessary.
046	1CO	012	023	And apo those mebres of yt body which we thinke lest honest put we most honestie on.  And oure vngodly parties have most beauty on.
046	1CO	012	024	For oure honest members nede it not.  But God hath so disposed the body ad hath geven most honoure to that parte which laked
046	1CO	012	025	lest there shuld be eny stryfe in the body: but that the members shuld indifferetly care one for another.
046	1CO	012	026	And yf one member suffer all suffer with him: yf one member be had in honoure all members be glad also.
046	1CO	012	027	Ye are the body of Christ and members one of another.
046	1CO	012	028	And God hath also ordeyned in the congregacion fyrst the Apostels secodarely prophetes thyrdly teachers then the that do miracles: after that the gyftes of healynge helpers governers diversite of tonges.
046	1CO	012	029	Are all Apostles?  Are all Prophetes?  Are all teachers?  Are all doars of miracles?
046	1CO	012	030	Have all the gyftes of healinge?  Do all speake wt tonges?  Do all interprete?
046	1CO	012	031	Covet after ye best giftes.  Amd yet shewe I vnto you a moare excellent waye.
046	1CO	013	001	Though I spake with the tonges of me and angels and yet had no love I were eve as soundinge brasse: or as a tynklynge Cymball.
046	1CO	013	002	And though I coulde prophesy and vnderstode all secretes and all knowledge: yee yf I had all fayth so that I coulde move moutayns oute of ther places and yet had no love I were nothynge.
046	1CO	013	003	And though I bestowed all my gooddes to fede ye poore and though I gave my body even that I burned and yet had no love it profeteth me nothinge.
046	1CO	013	004	Love suffreth longe and is corteous.  Love envieth not.  Love doth not frowardly swelleth not dealeth
046	1CO	013	005	not dishonestly seketh not her awne is not provoked to anger thynketh not evyll
046	1CO	013	006	reioyseth not in iniquite: but reioyseth in ye trueth
046	1CO	013	007	suffreth all thynge beleveth all thynges hopeth all thynges endureth in all thynges.
046	1CO	013	008	Though that prophesyinge fayle other tonges shall cease ) or knowledge vanysshe awaye yet love falleth never awaye
046	1CO	013	009	For oure knowledge is vnparfect and oure prophesyinge is vnperfet.
046	1CO	013	010	But when yt which is parfect is come then yt which is vnparfet shall be done awaye.
046	1CO	013	011	When I was a chylde I spake as a chylde I vnderstode as a childe I ymagened as a chylde.  But assone as I was a man I put awaye childesshnes.
046	1CO	013	012	Now we se in a glasse even in a darke speakynge: but then shall we se face to face.  Now I knowe vnparfectly: but then shall I knowe even as I am knowen.
046	1CO	013	013	Now abideth fayth hope and love even these thre: but the chefe of these is love.
046	1CO	014	001	Labour for love and covet spretuall giftes: and most chefly forto prophesye.
046	1CO	014	002	For he that speaketh with toges speaketh not vnto men but vnto god for no man heareth him how be it in the sprete he speaketh misteries.
046	1CO	014	003	But he that prophesieth speaketh vnto men to edifyinge to exhortacion and to comforte.
046	1CO	014	004	He that speaketh with tonges proffiteth him silfe: he that prophesyeth edifieth the congregacion.
046	1CO	014	005	I wolde that ye all spake with tonges: but rather that ye prophesied.  For greater is he that prophisieth?  then he yt speaketh with tonges except he expounde it also that the congregacion maye have edifyinge.
046	1CO	014	006	Now brehren if I come vnto you speakige wt tonges: what shall I profit you excepte I speake vnto you other by revelacio or knowledge or prophesyinge or doctrine.
046	1CO	014	007	Moreover whe thinges with out lyfe geve sounde: whether it be a pype or an harpe: except they make a distinccion in the soundes: how shall it be knowen what is pyped or harped?
046	1CO	014	008	And also if the trope geve an vncertayne voyce who shall prepare him silfe to fyght?
046	1CO	014	009	Eve so lykwyse whe ye speake with toges excepte ye speake wordes that have signification how shall yt be vnderstonde what is spoke?  For ye shall but speake in the ayer.
046	1CO	014	010	Many kyndes of voyces are in the worlde and none of them are with out signification.
046	1CO	014	011	If I knowe not what the voyce meaneth I shalbe vnto him that speaketh an alient: and and he that speaketh shalbe an alient vnto me
046	1CO	014	012	Eve so ye (for as moche as ye covet spretuall giftes) seke that ye maye have plentye vnto ye edifyinge of the congregacion.
046	1CO	014	013	Wherfore let him that speaketh with tonges praye that he maye interpret also.
046	1CO	014	014	If I praye with tonge my sprete prayeth: but my mynde is with out frute.
046	1CO	014	015	What is it then?  I will praye with the sprete ad will praye wt the mynde also.  I will singe with the sprete and will singe with the mynde also.
046	1CO	014	016	For els when thou blessest with ye sprete how shall he that occupieth the roume of the vnlearned saye amen at thy gevinge of thankes seynge he vnderstondeth not what thou sayest
046	1CO	014	017	Thou verely gevest thankes well but the other is not edyfied.
046	1CO	014	018	I thanke my god I speake with toges moare then ye all.
046	1CO	014	019	Yet had I lever in ye cogregacio to speake five wordes with my mynde to ye informacio of other rather then ten thousande wordes wt the tonge.
046	1CO	014	020	Brethre be not chyldre in witte.  How be it as cocerninge maliciousnes be chyldre: but in witte be perfet.
046	1CO	014	021	In the lawe it is written with other toges and with other lyppes wyll I speake vnto this people and yet for all that will they not heare me sayth the Lorde.
046	1CO	014	022	Wherfore tonges are for a signe not to them that beleve: but to them that beleve not.  Contrary wyse prophesyinge serveth not for them that beleve not: but for them which beleve.
046	1CO	014	023	Yf therfore when all the cogregacion is come to gedder and all speake with tonges ther come in they yt are vnlearned or they which beleve not: will they not saye that ye are out of youre wittes?
046	1CO	014	024	But and yf all prophesy and ther come in one that beleveth not or one vnlearned he is rebuked of all men and is iudged of every man:
046	1CO	014	025	and so are ye secretes of his hert opened and so falleth he doune on his face and worshippeth God and sayth yt God is wt you in dede.
046	1CO	014	026	How is it then brethre?  When ye come to gedder every ma hath his songe hath his doctryne hath his toge hath his revelacio hath his interpretacio.  Let all thinges be done vnto edifyinge.
046	1CO	014	027	If eny man speake wt tonges let it be two at once or at the most thre at once and that by course: and let another interprete it.
046	1CO	014	028	But yf ther be no interpreter let him kepe silence in the cogregacion and let him speake to him selfe and to God.
046	1CO	014	029	Let the Prophetes speake two at once or thre at once and let other iudge.
046	1CO	014	030	Yf eny revelacio be made to another that sitteth by let the fyrst holde his peace.
046	1CO	014	031	For ye maye all prophesy one by one that all maye learne and all maye have comforte.
046	1CO	014	032	For ye spretes of the Prophetes are in the power of the Prophetes.
046	1CO	014	033	For God is not causer of stryfe: but of peace as he is in all other congregacions of the saynctes.
046	1CO	014	034	Let youre wyves kepe silence in the cogregacions.  For it is not permitted vnto them to speake: but let them be vnder obedience as sayth the lawe.
046	1CO	014	035	If they will learne enythinge let the axe their husbandes at home.  For it is a shame for wemen to speake in the cogregacio.
046	1CO	014	036	Sproge ye worde of god fro you?  Ether came it vnto you only?
046	1CO	014	037	Yf eny ma thinke him sylfe a prophet ether spirituall: let him vnderstonde what thinges I write vnto you.  For they are the comaundementes of the Lorde.
046	1CO	014	038	But and yf eny man be ignorat let him be ignorant.
046	1CO	014	039	Wherfore brethren covet to prophesye and forbyd not to speake with tonges.
046	1CO	014	040	And let all thinges be done honestly and in order.
046	1CO	015	001	Brethren as pertayninge to the gospell which I preached vnto you which ye have also accepted and in the which ye continue
046	1CO	015	002	by which also ye are saved: I do you to wit after what maner I preached vnto you yf ye kepe it except ye have beleved in vayne.
046	1CO	015	003	For fyrst of all I delivered vnto you that which I receaved: how that Christ dyed for oure synnes agreinge to the scriptures:
046	1CO	015	004	and that he was buried and that he arose agayne the thyrd daye accordinge to the scriptures:
046	1CO	015	005	and that he he was sene of Cephas then of the twelve.
046	1CO	015	006	After that he was sene of moo the five hodred brethren at once: of which many remayne vnto this daye and many are fallen aslepe.
046	1CO	015	007	After that appered he to Iames then to all the Apostles.
046	1CO	015	008	And last of all he was sene of me as of one that was borne out of due tyme.
046	1CO	015	009	For I am the lest of all the Apostles which am not worthy to be called an Apostle because I persecuted the congregacion of God.
046	1CO	015	010	But by the grace of God I am that I am.  And his grace which is in me was not in vayne: but I labored moare aboundauntly then they all not I but the grace of God which is with me.
046	1CO	015	011	Whether it were I or they so we preache and so have ye beleved.
046	1CO	015	012	If Christ be preached how that he rose fro deeth: how saye some that are amoge you that ther is no resurreccion from deeth?
046	1CO	015	013	If ther be no rysynge agayne from deeth: then is Christ not rysen.
046	1CO	015	014	If Christ be not rysen then is oure preachinge vayne and youre faith is also in vayne.
046	1CO	015	015	Ye and we are founde falce witnesses of God.  For we have testifyed of God how that he raysyd vp Christ whom he raysyd not vp yf it be so that the deed ryse not vp agayne.
046	1CO	015	016	For yf the deed ryse not agayne then is Christ not rysen agayne.
046	1CO	015	017	If it be so yt Christ rose not then is youre fayth in vayne and yet are ye in youre synnes.
046	1CO	015	018	And therto they which are fallen a slepe in Christ are perished.
046	1CO	015	019	If in this lyfe only we beleve on christ then are we of all men the miserablest.
046	1CO	015	020	But now is Christ rysen from deeth and is become the fyrst frutes of them that slept.
046	1CO	015	021	For by a man came deeth and by a man came resurreccion fro deeth.
046	1CO	015	022	For as by Adam all dye: eve so by Christ shall all be made alive
046	1CO	015	023	and every man in his awne order.  The fyrst is Christ then they yt are Christis at his commynge.
046	1CO	015	024	Then cometh the ende when he hath delivered vp ye kyngdome to God ye father when he hath put doune all rule auctorite and power.
046	1CO	015	025	For he must raygne tyll he have put all his enemyes vnder his fete.
046	1CO	015	026	The last enemye that shalbe destroyed is deeth.
046	1CO	015	027	For he hath put all thinges vnder his fete.  But when he sayth all thinges are put vnder him it is manyfest that he is excepted which dyd put all thinges vnder him.
046	1CO	015	028	When all thinges are subdued vnto him: then shall the sonne also him selfe be subiecte vnto him that put all thinges vnder him yt God maye be all in all thinges.
046	1CO	015	029	Ether els what do they which are baptised over ye deed yf the deed ryse not at all?  Why are they then baptised over the deed?
046	1CO	015	030	Ye and why stonde we in ieoperdy every houre?
046	1CO	015	031	By oure reioysinge which I have in Christ Iesu oure Lorde I dye dayly.
046	1CO	015	032	That I have fought with beastes at Ephesus after the maner of men what avautageth it me yf the deed ryse not agayne?  Let vs eate and drynke to morowe we shall dye.
046	1CO	015	033	Be not deceaved: malicious speakinges corrupte good maners.
046	1CO	015	034	Awake truely out of slepe and synne not.  For some have not the knowlege of God.  I speake this vnto youre rebuke.
046	1CO	015	035	But some ma will saye: how aryse ye deed?  with what bodyes come they in?
046	1CO	015	036	Thou fole that which thou sowest is not quickened except it dye.
046	1CO	015	037	And what sowest thow?  Thow sowest not that body that shalbe: but bare corne (I meane ether of wheet or of some other)
046	1CO	015	038	and God geveth it a body at his pleasure to every seed a severall body.
046	1CO	015	039	All flesshe is not one manner of flesshe: but ther is one maner flesshe of men another maner flesshe of beastes another maner flesshe of fysshes and another of byrdes.
046	1CO	015	040	Ther are celestiall bodyes and ther are bodyes terrestriall.  But ye glory of ye celestiall is one and ye glory of the terrestriall is another.
046	1CO	015	041	Ther is one maner glory of the sonne and another glory of the mone and another glory of the starres.  For one starre differth fro another in glory.
046	1CO	015	042	So is the resurreccio of ye deed.  It is sowe in corrupcio and ryseth in incorrupcion.
046	1CO	015	043	It is sowen in dishonoure and ryseth in honoure.  It is sowe in weaknes and ryseth in power.  It is sowne a naturall body and ryseth a spretuall body.
046	1CO	015	044	Ther is a naturall bodye and ther is a spretuall body:
046	1CO	015	045	as it is written: the fyrste man Adam was made a livinge soule: and ye last Ada was made a quickeninge sprete.
046	1CO	015	046	How be it yt is not fyrst which is spirituall: but yt which is naturall and then yt which is spretuall.
046	1CO	015	047	The fyrst ma is of the erth erthy: the seconde man is ye Lorde fro heave.
046	1CO	015	048	As is the erthy soche are they that are erthye.  And as is the hevely soche are they yt are hevenly.
046	1CO	015	049	And as we have borne the ymage of the erthy so shall we beare the ymage of the hevenly.
046	1CO	015	050	This saye I brethren that flesshe and bloud canot inheret the kyngdome of God.  Nether corrupcion inhereth vncorrupcion.
046	1CO	015	051	Beholde I shewe you a mystery.  We shall not all slepe: but we shall all be chaunged
046	1CO	015	052	and that in a moment and in the twinclinge of an eye at the sounde of the last trompe.  For the trompe shall blowe and ye deed shall ryse incorruptible and we shalbe chaunged.
046	1CO	015	053	For this corruptible must put on incorruptibilite: and this mortall must put on immortalite.
046	1CO	015	054	When this corruptible hath put on incorruptibilite and this mortall hath put on immortalite: then shalbe brought to passe ye sayinge yt is writte.  Deeth is consumed in to victory.
046	1CO	015	055	Deeth where is thy stynge?  Hell where is thy victory?
046	1CO	015	056	The stynge of deeth is synne: and the strength of synne is the lawe.
046	1CO	015	057	But thankes be vnto God which hath geven vs victory thorow oure Lorde Iesus Christ.
046	1CO	015	058	Therfore my deare brethren be ye stedfast and unmovable alwayes ryche in the workes of the Lorde for as moch as ye knowe how yt youre labour is not in vayne in the Lorde.
046	1CO	016	001	Of the gadderynge for the saynctes as I have ordeyned in the congregacios of Galacia even so do ye.
046	1CO	016	002	Vpon some sondaye let every one of you put a syde at home and laye vp what soever he thinketh mete that ther be no gaderinges when I come.
046	1CO	016	003	When I am come whosoever ye shall alowe by youre letters them will I sende to bringe youre liberalite vnto Ierusalem.
046	1CO	016	004	And yf it be mete yt I goo they shall go with me.
046	1CO	016	005	I will come vnto you after I have gone over Macedonia.  For I will goo thorowout Macedonia.
046	1CO	016	006	With you paraveture I wyll abyde awhyle: or els winter that ye maye brynge me on my waye whyther soever I goo.
046	1CO	016	007	I will not se you now in my passage: but I trust to abyde a whyle with you yf God shall suffre me.
046	1CO	016	008	I will tary at Ephesus untyll whit sontyde.
046	1CO	016	009	For a greate dore and a frutefull is opened vnto me: and ther are many adversaries.
046	1CO	016	010	If Timotheus come se yt he be with out feare with you.  For he worketh the worke of the Lorde as I doo.
046	1CO	016	011	Let no man despyse him: but convaye him forthe in peace yt he maye come vnto me.  For I loke for him with the brethre.
046	1CO	016	012	To speake of brother Apollo: I greatly desyred him to come vnto you with ye brethren but his mynde was not at all to come at this tyme.  How be it he will come when he shall have conveniet tyme.
046	1CO	016	013	Watche ye stonde fast in the fayth auyte you lyke men and be stronge.
046	1CO	016	014	Let all youre busynes be done in love.
046	1CO	016	015	Brethren (ye knowe the housse of Stephana how yt they are the fyrst frutes of Achaia and that they have appoynted them selves to minister vnto the saynctes)
046	1CO	016	016	I beseche you yt ye be obedient vnto soche and to all that helpe and laboure.
046	1CO	016	017	I am gladde of the comynge of Stephana Fortunatus and Achaicus: for that which was lackinge on youre parte they have supplied.
046	1CO	016	018	They have comforted my sprete and youres.  Loke therfore that ye knowe them that are soche.
046	1CO	016	019	The congregacions of Asia salute you.  Aquila and Priscilla salute you moche in the Lorde and so doeth the congregacio that is in their housse.
046	1CO	016	020	All the brethren grete you.  Grete ye one another with an holy kysse.
046	1CO	016	021	The salutacion of me Paul with myne awne hande.
046	1CO	016	022	Yf eny man love not the Lorde Iesus Christ the same be anathema maranatha.
046	1CO	016	023	The grace of ye Lorde Iesus Christ be with you all.
046	1CO	016	024	My love be with you all in Christ Iesu.  Ame

# BOOK	058	HEB	Hebrews	Hebrews
058	HEB	001	001	God in tyme past diversly and many wayes spake vnto the fathers by Prophetes:
058	HEB	001	002	but in these last dayes he hath spoken vnto vs by his sonne whom he hath made heyre of all thinges: by who also he made the worlde.
058	HEB	001	003	Which sonne beynge the brightnes of his glory and very ymage of his substance bearinge vp all thinges with the worde of his power hath in his awne person pourged oure synnes and is sitten on the right honde of the maiestie an hye
058	HEB	001	004	and is more excellent then the angels in as moche as he hath by inheritaunce obteyned an excellenter name then have they.
058	HEB	001	005	For vnto which of the angels sayde he ateny tyme: Thou arte my sonne this daye be gate I the?  And agayne: I will be his father and he shalbe my sonne.
058	HEB	001	006	And agayne whe he bringeth in the fyrst begotten sonne in to the worlde he sayth: And all the angels of God shall worshippe him.
058	HEB	001	007	And of the angels he sayth: He maketh his angels spretes and his ministres flammes of fyre.
058	HEB	001	008	But vnto the sonne he sayth: God thy seate shalbe forever and ever.  The cepter of thy kyngdome is a right cepter.
058	HEB	001	009	Thou hast loved rightewesnes and hated iniquyte.  Wherfore God which is thy God hath anoynted the with ye oyle of gladnes above thy felowes.
058	HEB	001	010	And thou Lorde in the begynninge hast layde the foundacion of the erth.  And the heves are the workes of thy hondes.
058	HEB	001	011	They shall perisshe but thou shalt endure.  They all shall wexe olde as doth a garment:
058	HEB	001	012	and as a vesture shalt thou chaunge them and they shalbe chaunged.  But thou arte all wayes and thy yeres shall not fayle.
058	HEB	001	013	Vnto which of the angels sayde he at eny tyme?  Sit on my ryght honde tyll I make thyne enemyes thy fote stole.
058	HEB	001	014	Are they not all mynistrynge spretes sent to minister for their sakes which shalbe heyres of salvacion?
058	HEB	002	001	Wherfore we ought to geve ye more hede to ye thinges we have herde lest we perysshe.
058	HEB	002	002	For yf the worde which was spoke by angels was stedfast: so yt every trasgressio and disobediece receaved a iust recopece to rewarde:
058	HEB	002	003	how shall we escape yf we despyse so great saluacio which at ye fyrst bega to be preached of ye lorde him silfe and afterwarde was cofermed vnto vs warde by the ye hearde it
058	HEB	002	004	god bearynge witnes therto bothe with sygnes and wonders also and with divers miracles and gyftes of the holy gooste accordynge to his awne will.
058	HEB	002	005	He hath not vnto the angels put in subieccion the worlde to come where of we speake.
058	HEB	002	006	But one in a certayne place witnessed sayinge.  What is man that thou arte myndfull of him?
058	HEB	002	007	After thou haddest for a season made him lower then the angels: thou crounedst him with honour and glory and hast set him above the workes of thy hondes.
058	HEB	002	008	Thou hast put all thynges in subieccion vnder his fete.  In that he put all thynges vnder him he left nothynge that is not put vnder him.
058	HEB	002	009	Neverthelesse we yet se not all thynges subdued but him yt was made lesse the ye angelles: we se that it was Iesus which is crouned with glory and honour for the sofferinge of death: that he by the grace of god shulde tast of deeth for all men.
058	HEB	002	010	For it becam him for whom are all thynges and by whom are all thynges after that he had brought many sonnes vnto glory that he shuld make the lorde of their saluacion parfect thorow sofferynge.
058	HEB	002	011	For he that sanctifieth and they which are sanctified are all of one.  For which causes sake he is not ashamde to call the brethren
058	HEB	002	012	sayinge: I will declare thy name vnto my brethren and in the myddes of the congregacio will I prayse the.
058	HEB	002	013	And agayne: I will put my trust in him.  And agayne.  beholde here am I and the children which god hath geven me.
058	HEB	002	014	For as moche then as the children were parte takers of flesshe and bloud he also him silfe lyke wyse toke parte with them for to put doune thorow deth him that had lordshippe over deeth that is to saye the devyll
058	HEB	002	015	and yt he myght delyver the which thorow feare of deeth were all their lyfetyme in dauger of bondage.
058	HEB	002	016	For he in no place taketh on him the angels: but the seede of Abraham taketh he on him.
058	HEB	002	017	Wherfore in all thynges it became him to be made lyke vnto his brethre that he myght be mercifull and a faythfull hye preste in thynges concernynge god for to pourge the peoples synnes.
058	HEB	002	018	For in that he him silfe suffered and was tempted he is able to sucker them that are tempted.
058	HEB	003	001	Wherfore holy brethren partakers of the celestiall callinge cosyder the embasseatour and hye prest of oure profession Christ Iesus
058	HEB	003	002	which was faythfull to him that made him even as was Moses in all his housse.
058	HEB	003	003	And this man was counted worthy of more glory then Moses: In as moche as he which hath prepared the housse hath most honoure in the housse.
058	HEB	003	004	Every housse is prepared of some man.  But he that ordeyned all thinges is god.
058	HEB	003	005	And Moses verely was faythfull in all his housse as a minister to beare witnes of tho thinges which shuld be spoken afterwarde.
058	HEB	003	006	But Christ as a sonne hath rule over the housse whose housse are we so that we hold fast the confydence and the reioysynge of that hope vnto the ende.
058	HEB	003	007	Wherfore as the holy goost sayth: to daye if ye shall heare his voyce
058	HEB	003	008	harden not youre hertes after the rebellyon in the daye of temptacion in the wildernes
058	HEB	003	009	where youre fathers tempted me proved me and sawe my workes xl.  yeare longe.
058	HEB	003	010	Wherfore I was greved wt ye generacio and sayde.  They erre ever in their hertes: they verely have not knowe my wayes
058	HEB	003	011	so that I sware in my wrathe that they shuld not enter into my rest.
058	HEB	003	012	Take hede brethren that therbe in none of you an evyll herte in vnbeleve that he shuld departe from ye lyvynge god:
058	HEB	003	013	but exhorte one another dayly whill is it called to daye lest eny of you wexe harde herted thorow ye deceytfullnesse of sinne
058	HEB	003	014	We are partetakers of Christ yf we kepe sure vnto the ende the fyrst substance
058	HEB	003	015	so longe as it is sayd: to daye yf ye heare his voyce harde not youre hertes as when ye rebelled.
058	HEB	003	016	For some whe they hearde rebelled: howbe it not all yt ca out of Egypt vnder Moses.
058	HEB	003	017	But with who was he despleased. xl.  yeares?  Was he not displeased with them that synned: whose carkases were overthorwen in the desert?
058	HEB	003	018	To whom sware he that they shuld not enter into his rest: but vnto them that beleved not?
058	HEB	003	019	And we se that they coulde not enter in because of vnbeleve.
058	HEB	004	001	Let vs feare therfore lest eny of vs forsakynge the promes of entrynge into his rest shulde seme to come behinde.
058	HEB	004	002	For vnto vs was it declared as well as vnto them.  But it proffited not them that they hearde the worde because they which hearde it coupled it not with fayth.
058	HEB	004	003	But we which have beleved do enter into his rest as contrarywyse he sayde to the other: I have sworne in my wrath they shall not enter into my rest.  And that spake he verely longe after that the workes were made and the foudacio of ye worlde layde.
058	HEB	004	004	For he spake in a certayne place of ye seveth daye on this wyse: And god did rest ye seventh daye fro all his workes.
058	HEB	004	005	And in this place agayne: They shall not come into my rest.
058	HEB	004	006	Seynge therfore it foloweth that some muste enter therinto and they to who it was fyrst preached entred not therin for vnbeleves sake.
058	HEB	004	007	Agayne he apoynteth in David a certayne present daye after so longe a tyme sayinge as it is rehearsed: this daye if ye heare his voyce be not harde herted.
058	HEB	004	008	For if Iosue had geven them rest then wolde he not afterwarde have spoke of another daye.
058	HEB	004	009	There remayneth therfore yet a rest to ye people of God.
058	HEB	004	010	For he yt is is entred into his rest doth cease from his awne workes as god did from his.
058	HEB	004	011	Let vs study therfore to entre into that rest lest eny man faule after the same ensample in to vnbelefe.
058	HEB	004	012	For the worde of god is quycke and myghty in operacion and sharper then eny two edged swearde: and entreth through even vnto the dividynge asonder of the soule and the sprete and of the ioyntes and the mary: and iudgeth the thoughtes and the intentes of the herte:
058	HEB	004	013	nether is there eny creature invisible in the sight of it.  For all thynges are naked and bare vnto the eyes of him of who we speake.
058	HEB	004	014	Seynge then that we have a great hye prest whych is entred into heven (I meane Iesus the sonne of God) let vs holde oure profession.
058	HEB	004	015	For we have not an hye prest which can not have compassion on oure infirmities: but was in all poyntes tempted lyke as we are: but yet with out synne.
058	HEB	004	016	Let vs therfore goo boldely vnto the seate of grace that we maye receave mercy and fynde grace to helpe in tyme of nede.
058	HEB	005	001	For every hye prest that is taken from amoge men is ordeyned for men in thynges pertaynynge to god: to offer gyftes and sacryfyses for synne:
058	HEB	005	002	which can have compassion on the ignoraunt and on them that are out of the waye because that he him silfe also is compased with infirmitie:
058	HEB	005	003	For the which infirmities sake he is bounde to offer for synnes as well for hys awne parte as for the peoples.
058	HEB	005	004	And no man taketh honour vnto him silfe but he that is called of God as was Aaron.
058	HEB	005	005	Even so lykewise Christ glorified not him silfe to be made the hye prest: but he that sayde vnto him: thou arte my sonne this daye begat I the glorified him.
058	HEB	005	006	As he also in another place speaketh: Thou arte a prest for ever after the order of Melchisedech.
058	HEB	005	007	Which in the dayes of his flesshe did offer vp prayers and sup plicacions with stronge cryinge and teares vnto him that was able to save him from deeth: and was also hearde because of his godlines.
058	HEB	005	008	And though he were Goddes sonne yet learned he obediece by tho thynges which he suffered
058	HEB	005	009	and was made parfaite and the cause of eternall saluacion vnto all them that obey him:
058	HEB	005	010	and is called of God an hye prest after the order of Melchisedech.
058	HEB	005	011	Wherof we have many thynges to saye which are harde to be vttered: because ye are dull of hearinge.
058	HEB	005	012	For when as cocerninge ye tyme ye ought to be teachers yet have ye nede agayne that we teache you the fyrst principles of the worde of god: and are become soche as have nede of mylke and not of stronge meate:
058	HEB	005	013	For every man that is feed with mylke is inexperte in the worde of rightewesnes.  For he is but a babe.
058	HEB	005	014	But stronge meate belongeth to them that are parfecte which thorow custome have their wittes exercised to iudge both good and evyll also.
058	HEB	006	001	Wherfore let vs leave ye doctryne pertayninge to the beginninge of a Christen man and let vs go vnto perfeccio and now no more laye the foundacio of repentaunce from deed workes and of fayth towarde God
058	HEB	006	002	of baptyme of doctryne and of layinge on of hondes and of resurreccion from deeth and of eternall iudgemet.
058	HEB	006	003	And so will we do yf God permitte.
058	HEB	006	004	For it is not possible yt they which were once lyghted and have tasted of the hevenly gyft and were become partetakers of the holy goost
058	HEB	006	005	and have tasted of the good worde of God and of the power of the worlde to come:
058	HEB	006	006	yf they faule shuld be renued agayne vnto repentaunce: for as moche as they have (as concerninge them selves) crucified the sonne of God a fresshe makynge a mocke of him.
058	HEB	006	007	For that erth which drinketh in the rayne wich cometh ofte vpon it and bringeth forth erbes mete for them that dresse it receaveth blessynge of god.
058	HEB	006	008	But that grounde which beareth thornes and bryars is reproved and is nye vnto cursynge: whose ende is to be burned.
058	HEB	006	009	Neverthelesse deare frendes we trust to se better of you and thynges which accompany saluacion though we thus speake.
058	HEB	006	010	For god is not vnrighteous that he shuld forget youre worke and laboure that procedeth of love which love shewed in his name which have ministred vnto the saynctes and yet minister
058	HEB	006	011	Yee and we desyre that every one of you shew the same diligence to the stablysshynge of hope even vnto the ende:
058	HEB	006	012	that ye faynt not but folowe them which thorow fayth and pacience inheret the promyses.
058	HEB	006	013	For when god made promes to Abraham because he had no greater thinge to sweare by he sware by him silfe
058	HEB	006	014	sayinge: Surely I will blesse the and multiply the in dede.
058	HEB	006	015	And so after that he had taryed a longe tyme he enioyed the promes.
058	HEB	006	016	Men verely sweare by him that is greater then them selves and an othe to confyrme the thynge ys amonge them an ende of all stryfe.
058	HEB	006	017	So god willynge very aboundanly to shewe vnto the heyres of promes the stablenes of his counsayle he added an othe
058	HEB	006	018	that by two immutable thinges (in which it was vnpossible that god shuld lye) we myght have parfect consolacion which have fled for to holde fast the hope that is set before vs
058	HEB	006	019	which hope we have as an ancre of the soule both sure and stedfast.  Which hope also entreth in into tho thynges which are with in the vayle
058	HEB	006	020	whither ye fore runner is for vs entred in I mea Iesus that is made an hye prest for ever after the order of Melchisedech.
058	HEB	007	001	This Melchisedech kynge of Salem (which beinge prest of ye most hye god met Abraham as he returned agayne from the slaughter of the kynges and blessed him:
058	HEB	007	002	to whom also Abraham gave tythes of all thynges) fyrst is by interpretacion kynge of rightewesnes: after yt he is kynge of Sale yt is to saye kynge of peace
058	HEB	007	003	with out father wt out mother with out kynne and hath nether begynnynge of his tyme nether yet ende of his lyfe: but is lykened vnto the sonne of god and cotinueth a preste for ever.
058	HEB	007	004	Consyder what a man this was vnto who the patriarke Abraham gave tythes of the spoyles.
058	HEB	007	005	And verely those children of levy which receave the office of the prestes have a commaundement to take a cordyng to the lawe tythes of the people that is to saye of their brethren yee though they spronge out of the loynes of Abraham.
058	HEB	007	006	But he whose kynred is not counted amonge them receaved tythes of Abraham and blessed him that had the promyses.
058	HEB	007	007	And no man denyeth but that which is lesse receaveth blessinge of yt which is greater.
058	HEB	007	008	And here men that dye receave tythes.  But there he receaveth tythes of whom it is witnessed that he liveth.
058	HEB	007	009	And to saye the trueth Levy him silfe also which receaveth tythes payed tythes in Abraham.
058	HEB	007	010	For he was yet in the loynes of his father Abraham when Melchisech met him.
058	HEB	007	011	Yf now therfore perfeccion came by the presthod of the levites (for vnder that presthod the people recaved the lawe) what neded it furthermore that an other prest shuld ryse after the order of Melchisedech and not after the order of Aaron?
058	HEB	007	012	Now no dout yf the presthod be translated then of necessitie must the lawe be translated also.
058	HEB	007	013	For he of whom these thynges are spoken pertayneth vnto another trybe of which never man served at the aultre.
058	HEB	007	014	For it is evidet that oure lorde spronge of the trybe of Iuda of which trybe spake Moses nothynge concernynge presthod.
058	HEB	007	015	And it is yet a more evydent thinge yf after the similitude of Melchisedech ther aryse a nother prest
058	HEB	007	016	which is not made after the lawe of the carnall commaundmet: but after the power of the endlesse lyfe
058	HEB	007	017	(For he testifieth: Thou arte a prest forever after the order of Melchysedech)
058	HEB	007	018	Then the commaundmet that went a fore is disanulled because of hir weaknes and vnproffitablenes.
058	HEB	007	019	For the lawe made nothynge parfecte: but was an introduccion of a better hope by which hope we drawe nye vnto god.
058	HEB	007	020	And for this cause it is a better hope that it was not promysed with out an othe.
058	HEB	007	021	Those prestes were made wt out an oth: but this prest with an oth by him that saide vnto him The lorde sware and will not repent: Thou arte a prest for ever after the order of Melchisedech.
058	HEB	007	022	And for that cause was Iesus a stablyssher of a better testament.
058	HEB	007	023	And amonge them many were made prestes because they were not suffred to endure by the reason of deeth.
058	HEB	007	024	But this man because he endureth ever hath an everlastinge presthod.
058	HEB	007	025	Wherfore he is able also ever to save them that come vnto god by him seynge he ever lyveth to make intercession for vs.
058	HEB	007	026	Soche an hye prest it became vs to have which is wholy harmlesse vndefyled separat from synners and made hyar then heven.
058	HEB	007	027	Which nedeth not dayly (as yonder hie prestes) to offer vp sacrifice fyrst for his awne synnes and then for the peoples synnes.  For that did he at once for all when he offered vp him silfe.
058	HEB	007	028	For the lawe maketh men prestes which have infirmitie: but the worde of the othe that came fence ye lawe maketh the sonne prest which is parfecte for ever more.
058	HEB	008	001	Of the thynges which we have spoke this is the pyth: that we have soche an hye preste that is sitten on ye right honde of the seate of maieste in heven
058	HEB	008	002	and is a minister of holy thynges and of the very tabernacle which God pyght and not ma.
058	HEB	008	003	For every hye prest is ordeyned to offer gyftes and sacryfises wherfore it is of necessitie that this man have somewhat also to offer.
058	HEB	008	004	For he were not a preste yf he were on ye erth where are prestes that acordynge to ye lawe
058	HEB	008	005	offer giftes which prestes serve vnto ye ensample and shadowe of hevenly thynges: even as the answer of God was geven vnto Moses when he was about to fynnishe the tabernacle: Take hede (sayde he) that thou make all thynges accordynge to the patrone shewed to the in the mount.
058	HEB	008	006	Now hath he obtayned a more excellent office in as moche as he is the mediator of a better testament which was made for better promyses.
058	HEB	008	007	For yf that fyrst testament had bene fautelesse: then shuld no place have bene sought for the seconde.
058	HEB	008	008	For in rebukynge the he sayth: Beholde the dayes will come (sayth the lorde) and I will fynnyshe apon the housse of Israhel and apon the housse of Iuda
058	HEB	008	009	a newe testament: not lyke the testament that I made with their fathers at that tyme whe I toke them by the hondes to lede them oute of the londe of Egipte for they continued not in my testament and I regarded them not sayth the lorde.
058	HEB	008	010	For this is the testament that I will make with the housse of Israhell: After those dayes sayth the lorde: I will put my lawes in their myndes and in their hertes I will wryte the and I wilbe their God and they shalbe my people.
058	HEB	008	011	And they shall not teache every man his neghboure and every man his brother sayinge: knowe the lorde: For they shall knowe me from the lest to the moste of them:
058	HEB	008	012	For I wilbe mercifull over their vnrightwesnes and on their synnes and on their iniquiries.
058	HEB	008	013	In yt he sayth a new testament he hath abrogat the olde.  Now that which is disanulled and wexed olde is redy to vannysshe awaye.
058	HEB	009	001	That fyrst tabernacle verely had ordinaunces and servynges of god and wordly holynes.
058	HEB	009	002	For there was a fore tabernacle made wherin was the candlesticke and the table and the shewe breed which is called wholy.
058	HEB	009	003	But with in the secode vayle was ther a tabernacle which is called holiest of all
058	HEB	009	004	which had the golden senser and the arcke of the testamet overlayde round about with golde wherin was the golden pot with manna and Aarons rodde that spronge and the tables of the testament.
058	HEB	009	005	Over the arcke were the cherubis of glory shadowynge the seate of grace.  Of which thynges we wyll not now speake perticularly.
058	HEB	009	006	When these thynges were thus ordeyned the prestes went all wayes into the fyrst tabernacle and executed the service of god.
058	HEB	009	007	But into the seconde went the hye prest alone once every yeare: and not with out bloud which he offered for him silfe and for the ignoraunce of ye people.
058	HEB	009	008	Wherwith ye holy goost this signifyeng yt the waye of holy thynges was not yet opened whill as yet ye fyrst tabernacle was stondynge.
058	HEB	009	009	Which was a similitude for the tyme then present and in which were offered gyftes and sacrifises that coulde not make them that minister parfecte as pertaynynge to the conscience
058	HEB	009	010	with only meates and drinkes and divers wesshynges and iustifyinges of the flesshe which were ordeyned vntyll the tyme of reformacion.
058	HEB	009	011	But Christ beynge an hye prest of good thynges to come came by a greater and a moare parfecte tabernacle not made with hondes: that is to saye not of this maner bildynge
058	HEB	009	012	nether by the bloud of gotes and calves: but by his awne bloud we entred once for all into the holy place and founde eternall redemcion.
058	HEB	009	013	For yf the bloud of oxen and of Gotes and the asshes of an heyfer whe it was sprynckled puryfied the vnclene as touchynge the purifiynge of the flesshe:
058	HEB	009	014	How moche more shall the bloud of Christ (which thorow the eternall sprete offered him silfe with out spot to God) pourdge youre consciences from deed workes for to serve the livynge god?
058	HEB	009	015	And for this cause is he the mediator of ye newe testament that thorow deeth which chaunsed for the redempcion of those transgressions that were in ye fyrst testamet) they which were called myght receave the promes of eternall inheritaunce.
058	HEB	009	016	For whersoever is a testament there must also be the deeth of him that maketh the testament.
058	HEB	009	017	For the testament taketh auctoritie when men are deed: For it is of no value as longe as he that made it is alive.
058	HEB	009	018	For which cause also nether that fyrst testament was ordeyned with out bloud.
058	HEB	009	019	For when all the commaundementes were redde of Moses vnto all the people he toke ye bloud of calves and of Gotes with water and purple woll and ysope and sprynkled both the boke and all the people
058	HEB	009	020	sayinge: this is the bloud of the testament which god hath apoynted vnto you.
058	HEB	009	021	Morover he sprenkled the tabernacle with bloud also and all the ministrynge vessels.
058	HEB	009	022	And almost all thynges are bye the lawe pourged with bloud and with out effusion of bloud is no remission.
058	HEB	009	023	It is then nede that the similitudes of hevenly thynges be purified with soche thynges: but the hevenly thynges them selves are purified with better sacrifises then are those.
058	HEB	009	024	For Christ is not entred into the holy places that are made with hondes which are but similitudes of true thynges: but is entred into very heven for to appere now in the syght of God for vs:
058	HEB	009	025	not to offer him silfe often as the hye prest entreth in to ye holy place every yeare with straunge bloud
058	HEB	009	026	for then must he have often suffered sence the worlde bega.  But now in the ende of the worlde hath he appered once to put synne to flyght by the offerynge vp of him silfe.
058	HEB	009	027	And as it is apoynted vnto men that they shall once dye and then commeth the iudegement even
058	HEB	009	028	so Christ was once offered to take awaye the synnes of many and vnto them that loke for him shall he appeare agayne without synne vnto saluacion.
058	HEB	010	001	For the lawe which hath but the shadowe of good thynges to come and not the thynges in their awne fassion can never with ye sacryfises which they offer yere by yere continually make the comers thervnto parfayte.
058	HEB	010	002	For wolde not then those sacrifises have ceased to have bene offered because that the offerers once pourged shuld have had no moare conscieces of sinnes.
058	HEB	010	003	Neverthelesse in those sacrifises is ther mencion made of synnes every yeare.
058	HEB	010	004	For it is vnpossible that the bloud of oxen and of gotes shuld take awaye synnes.
058	HEB	010	005	Wherfore when he commeth into the worlde he sayth: Sacrifice and offeringe thou woldest not have: but a bodie hast thou ordeyned me.
058	HEB	010	006	In sacrifices and synne offerynges thou hast no lust.
058	HEB	010	007	Then I sayde: Lo I come in the chefest of the boke it is written of me that I shuld doo thy will o god.
058	HEB	010	008	Above when he had sayed sacrifice and offerynge and burnt sacrifices and synne offerynges thou woldest not have nether hast alowed (which yet are offered by the lawe)
058	HEB	010	009	and then sayde: Lo I come to do thy will o god: he taketh awaye the fyrst to stablisshe the latter.
058	HEB	010	010	By the which will we are sanctified by the offeringe of the body of Iesu Christe once for all.
058	HEB	010	011	And every prest is redy dayly ministrynge and ofte tymes offereth one maner of offerynge which can never take awaye synnes.
058	HEB	010	012	But this man after he had offered one sacrifyce for synnes sat him doune for ever on the right honde of god
058	HEB	010	013	and from hence forth tarieth till his foes be made his fotestole.
058	HEB	010	014	For with one offerynge hath he made parfecte for ever them yt are sanctified.
058	HEB	010	015	And ye holy goost also beareth vs recorde of this even when he tolde before:
058	HEB	010	016	This is the testament that I will make vnto them after those dayes sayth the lorde.  I will put my lawes in their hertes and in their mynde I will write them
058	HEB	010	017	and their synnes and iniquyties will I remember no moare.
058	HEB	010	018	And where remission of these thinges is there is no moare offerynge for synne.
058	HEB	010	019	Seynge brethren that by the meanes of the bloud of Iesu we maye be bolde to enter into that holy place
058	HEB	010	020	by the newe and livynge waye which he hath prepared for vs through the vayle that is to saye by his flesshe.
058	HEB	010	021	And seynge also that we have an hye prest which is ruler over ye housse of god
058	HEB	010	022	let vs drawe nye with a true herte in a full fayth sprynckeled in oure hertes from an evyll conscience and wesshed in oure bodies with pure water
058	HEB	010	023	and let vs kepe the profession of oure hope with oute waveringe (for he is faythfull that promysed)
058	HEB	010	024	and let vs consyder one another to provoke vnto love and to good workes:
058	HEB	010	025	and let vs not forsake the felishippe that we have amoge oure selves as the maner of some is: but let vs exhorte one another and that so moche the more because ye se that the daye draweth nye.
058	HEB	010	026	For yf we synne willyngly after that we have receaved the knowledge of the trueth there remayneth no more sacrifice for synnes
058	HEB	010	027	but a fearfull lokynge for iudgement and violent fyre which shall devoure the adversaries
058	HEB	010	028	He that despiseth Moses lawe dyeth with out mercy vnder two or thre witnesses.
058	HEB	010	029	Of how moche sorer punyshment suppose ye shall he be counted worthy which treadeth vnderfote the sonne of god: and counteth the bloude of the testament as an vnholy thynge wherwith he was sanctified and doth dishonoure to the sprete of grace.
058	HEB	010	030	For we knowe him that hath sayde vengeaunce belongeth vnto me I will recompence sayth the lorde.  And agayne: the lorde shall iudge his people.
058	HEB	010	031	It is a fearfull thynge to faule into the hondes of the livynge God.
058	HEB	010	032	Call to remebraunce the dayes that are passed in the which after ye had receaved light ye endured a greate fyght in adversities
058	HEB	010	033	partly whill all men wondred and gased at you for the shame and trioulacion that was done vnto you and partly whill ye became companyons of the which so passed their tyme.
058	HEB	010	034	For ye suffered also with my bondes and toke a worth the spoylynge of youre goodes and that with gladnes knowynge in youre selves how that ye had in heven a better and an endurynge substaunce
058	HEB	010	035	Cast not awaye therfore youre confidence which hath great rewarde to recopence.
058	HEB	010	036	For ye have nede of paciece that after ye have done ye will of god ye myght receave the promes.
058	HEB	010	037	For yet a very lytell whyle and he that shall come will come and will not tary.
058	HEB	010	038	But the iust shall live by faith.  And yf he withdrawe him silfe my soule shall have no pleasure in him.
058	HEB	010	039	We are not whiche withdrawe oure selves vnto dampnacio but partayne to fayth to the wynnynge of the soule.
058	HEB	011	001	Fayth is a sure confidence of thynges which are hoped for and a certayntie of thynges which are not sene.
058	HEB	011	002	By it ye elders were well reported of.
058	HEB	011	003	Thorow fayth we vnderstonde that the worlde was ordeyned by the worde of god: and that thynges which are sene were made of thynges which are not sene.
058	HEB	011	004	By fayth Abell offered vnto god a more plenteous sacrifice then Cayn: by which he obteyned witnes that he was righteous god testifyinge of his gyftes: by which also he beynge deed yet speaketh.
058	HEB	011	005	By fayth was Enoch traslated yt he shuld not se deeth: nether was he founde: for God had taken him awaye.  Before he was taken awaye he was reported of that he had pleased God:
058	HEB	011	006	but with out fayth it is vnpossible to please him.  For he that commeth to God must beleve that God is and that he is a rewarder of them that seke him.
058	HEB	011	007	By fayth Noe honored God after that he was warned of thinges which were not sene and prepared the arcke to the savinge of his houssholde thorowe the which arcke he condempned the worlde and became heyre of the rightewesnes which commeth by fayth.
058	HEB	011	008	By fayth Abraha whe he was called obeyed to goo out into a place which he shuld afterwarde receave to inheritaunce and he wet out not knowynge whether he shuld goo.
058	HEB	011	009	By fayth he removed into the londe yt was promysed him as into a straunge countre and dwelt in tabernacles: and so dyd Isaac and Iacob heyres with him of the same promes.
058	HEB	011	010	For he loked for a citie havinge a foundacio whose bylder and maker is God.
058	HEB	011	011	Thorow fayth Sara also receaved stregth to be with chylde and was delivered of a chylde when she was past age because she iudged him faythfull which had promysed.
058	HEB	011	012	And therfore spronge therof one (and of one which was as good as deed) so many in multitude as the starres of ye skye and as the sond of the see shore which is innumerable.
058	HEB	011	013	And they all dyed in fayth and receaved not the promyses: but sawe them a farre of and beleved them and saluted them: and confessed that they were straungers and pilgrems on the erthe.
058	HEB	011	014	They that saye soche thinges declare that they seke a coutre.
058	HEB	011	015	Also yf they had bene myndfull of that countre from whence they came oute they had leasure to have returned agayne.
058	HEB	011	016	But now they desyre a better that is to saye a hevenlye.  Wherfore God is not ashamed of them even to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a citie.
058	HEB	011	017	In fayth Abraham offered vp Isaac whe he was tempted and he offered him beinge his only begotten sonne which had receaved the promyses
058	HEB	011	018	of who it was sayde in Isaac shall thy seed be called:
058	HEB	011	019	for he cosidered that God was able to rayse vp agayne fro deeth.  Wherfore receaved he him for an ensample.
058	HEB	011	020	In fayth Isaac blessed Iacob and Esau concerninge thinges to come.
058	HEB	011	021	By fayth Iacob when he was a dyinge blessed both the sonnes of Ioseph and bowed him selfe towarde the toppe of his cepter.
058	HEB	011	022	By fayth Ioseph when he dyed remebred the departinge of the chyldren of Israel and gave commaundement of his bones.
058	HEB	011	023	By fayth Moses when he was borne was hid thre monethes of his father and mother be cause they sawe he was a proper chylde: nether feared they the kynges commaundemet.
058	HEB	011	024	By fayth Moses when he was great refused to be called ye sonne of Pharaos doughter
058	HEB	011	025	and chose rather to suffre adversitie wt the people of God then to enioye the pleasurs of synne for a ceason
058	HEB	011	026	and estemed the rebuke of Christ greater ryches then the treasure of Egypt.  For he had a respect vnto ye rewarde.
058	HEB	011	027	By fayth he forsoke Egypt and feared not the fearcenes of the kynge.  For he endured even as he had sene him which is invisible.
058	HEB	011	028	Thorow fayth he ordeyned the ester lambe and the effusion of bloud lest he that destroyed the fyrst borne shuld touche them.
058	HEB	011	029	By fayth they passed thorow the reed see as by drye londe which when the Egypcians had assayed to do they were drouned.
058	HEB	011	030	By fayth the walles of Ierico fell doune after they were copased about seven dayes.
058	HEB	011	031	By fayth ye harlot Raab perisshed not with the vnbelevers whe she had receaved the spyes to lodgynge peaseably.
058	HEB	011	032	And what shall I more saye ye tyme wold be to short for me to tell of Gedeo of Barach and of Samson and of Iephthae: also of David and Samuel and of the Prophetes:
058	HEB	011	033	which thorowe fayth subdued kyngdomes wrought righteousnes obteyned the promyses stopped the mouthes of lyons
058	HEB	011	034	queched the violence of fyre escaped the edge of the swearde of weake were made stroge waxed valient in fight turned to flyght the armyes of the alientes.
058	HEB	011	035	And the wemen receaved their deed raysed to lyfe agayne.  Other were racked and wolde not be delyvered that they myght receave a better resurreccion.
058	HEB	011	036	Other tasted of mockynges and scourginginges morover of bondes and presonmet:
058	HEB	011	037	were stoned were hewen a sunder were tepted were slayne with sweardes walked vppe and doune in shepes skynnes in gotes skynnes in nede tribulacio and vexacio
058	HEB	011	038	which ye worlde was not worthy of: they wadred in wildernes in moutaynes in dennes and caves of the erth.
058	HEB	011	039	And these all thorow fayth obtayned good reporte and receaved not the promes
058	HEB	011	040	God provydinge a better thinge for vs that they with out vs shuld not be made parfecte.
058	HEB	012	001	Wherfore let vs also (seynge that we are copased with so great a multitude of witnesses) laye awaye all that presseth doune and the synne that hageth on and let vs rune with paciece vnto the battayle yt is set before vs
058	HEB	012	002	lokynge vnto Iesus the auctor and fynnyssher of oure fayth which for the ioye that was set before him abode the crosse and despysed the shame and is set doune on the right honde of ye trone of God.
058	HEB	012	003	Consider therfore how that he endured suche speakinge agaynst him of synners lest ye shuld be weried and faynte in youre myndes.
058	HEB	012	004	For ye have not yet resisted vnto bloud sheddinge stryvinge agaynst synne.
058	HEB	012	005	And ye have forgotten the consolacion which speaketh vnto you as vnto chyldren: My sonne despyse not the chastenynge of the Lorde nether faynt when thou arte rebuked of him:
058	HEB	012	006	For whom the Lorde loveth him he chasteneth: yee and he scourgeth every sonne that he receaveth.
058	HEB	012	007	Yf ye endure chastninge God offereth him selfe vnto you as vnto sonnes.  What sonne is that whom the father chasteneth not?
058	HEB	012	008	If ye be not vnder correccio (where of all are part takers) then are ye bastardes and not sonnes.
058	HEB	012	009	Moreover seynge we had fathers of oure flesshe which corrected vs and we gave them reverence: shuld we not moche rather be in subieccion vnto the father of spretuall gyftes that we myght live?
058	HEB	012	010	And they verely for a feaue dayes nurtred vs after their awne pleasure: but he learneth vs vnto that which is proffitable that we myght receave of his holines.
058	HEB	012	011	No manner chastisynge for the present tyme semeth to be ioyeous but greveous: neverthelesse afterwarde it bryngeth the quyet frute of rightewesnes vnto them which are therin exercysed.
058	HEB	012	012	Stretch forthe therfore agayne the hondes which were let doune and the weake knees
058	HEB	012	013	and se that ye have strayght steppes vnto youre fete lest eny haltinge turne out of ye waye: yee let it rather be healed.
058	HEB	012	014	Embrace peace with all men and holynes: with out the which no man shall se the Lorde.
058	HEB	012	015	And looke to that no man be destitue of the grace of God and that no rote of bitternes springe vp and trouble and therby many be defiled:
058	HEB	012	016	and that there be no fornicator or vnclene person as Esau which for one breakfast solde his birthright.
058	HEB	012	017	Ye knowe how that afterwarde when he wolde have inherited the blessinge he was put by and he foude no meanes to come therby agayne: no though he desyred it with teares.
058	HEB	012	018	For ye are not come vnto the mounte that can be touched and vnto burninge fyre nor yet to myst and darcknes and tempest of wedder
058	HEB	012	019	nether vnto the sounde of a trope and the voyce of wordes: which voyce they that hearde it wisshed awaye that the comunicacion shuld not be spoken to them.
058	HEB	012	020	For they were not able to abyde that which was spoken.  If a beast had touched the mountayne it must have bene stoned or thrust thorowe with a darte:
058	HEB	012	021	eve so terreble was ye sight which appered.  Moses sayde I feare and quake.
058	HEB	012	022	But ye are come vnto the moute Sion and to the citie of the livinge god the celestiall Ierusalem: and to an innumerable sight of angels
058	HEB	012	023	and vnto the congregacion of ye fyrst borne sonnes which are writte in heven and to God the iudge of all and to the spretes of iust and parfecte men
058	HEB	012	024	and to Iesus the mediator of the newe testament and to the spryncklynge of bloud that speaketh better then the bloud of Abell.
058	HEB	012	025	Se that ye despise not him yt speaketh.  For yf they escaped not which refused him that spake on erth: moche more shall we not escape yf we turne awaye fro him yt speaketh fro heve:
058	HEB	012	026	whose voyce the shouke the erth and now declareth sayinge: yet once more will I shake not the erth only but also heven.
058	HEB	012	027	No dout yt same that he sayth yet once more signifieth the removinge a waye of those thinges which are shaken as of thinges which have ended their course: that the thynges which are not shaken maye remayne.
058	HEB	012	028	Wherfore if we receave a kyngdom which is not moved we have grace wherby we maye serve god and please him with reverence and godly feare.
058	HEB	012	029	For oure god is a consumynge fyre.
058	HEB	013	001	Let brotherly love continue.
058	HEB	013	002	Be not forgetfull to lodge straungers.  For therby have dyvers receaved angels into their houses vnwares.
058	HEB	013	003	Remember them that are in bondes even as though ye were bounde with them.  Be myndfull of them which are in adversitie as ye which are yet in youre bodies.
058	HEB	013	004	Let wedlocke be had in pryce in all poyntes and let the chamber be vndefiled: for whore kepers and advoutrars god will iudge.
058	HEB	013	005	Let youre conversacion be with out coveteousnes and be contet with that ye have all redy.  For he verely sayd: I will not fayle the nether forsake the:
058	HEB	013	006	that we maye boldly saye: the lorde is my helper and I will not feare what man doeth vnto me.
058	HEB	013	007	Remember them which have the oversight of you which have declared vnto you the worde of god.  The ende of whose conversacion se that ye looke vpon and folowe their fayth.
058	HEB	013	008	Iesus Christ yesterdaye and to daye and the same continueth for ever.
058	HEB	013	009	Be not caryed aboute with divers and straunge learnynge.  For it is a good thynge that the herte be stablisshed with grace and not with meates which have not proffeted them that have had their pastyme in them.
058	HEB	013	010	We have an altre wherof they maye not eate which serve in the tabernacle.
058	HEB	013	011	For ye bodies of those beastes whose bloud is brought into the holy place by the hie prest to pourge sinne are burnt with out the tentes.
058	HEB	013	012	Therfore Iesus to sanctifye the people with his awne bloud suffered with out the gate.
058	HEB	013	013	Let vs goo forth therfore out of the tentes and suffer rebuke with him.
058	HEB	013	014	For here have we no continuynge citie: but we seke one to come.
058	HEB	013	015	For by him offer we the sacrifice of laude allwayes to god: that is to saye the frute of those lyppes which confesse his name.
058	HEB	013	016	To do good and to distribute forget not for with suche sacrifises god is pleased.
058	HEB	013	017	Obeye the that have the oversight of you and submit youre selves to them for they watch for youre soules even as they that must geve a comptes: that they maye do it with ioye and not with grefe.  For that is an vnproffitable thynge for you.
058	HEB	013	018	Praye for vs.  We have confidence because we have a good conscience in all thynges and desyre to live honestly.
058	HEB	013	019	I desire you therfore somwhat the moare aboundantly that ye so do that I maye be restored to you quyckly.
058	HEB	013	020	The god of peace that brought agayne fro deth oure lorde Iesus the gret shepperde of the shepe thorowe the bloud of the everlastynge testamet
058	HEB	013	021	make you parfect in all good workes to do his will workynge in you yt which is pleasaut in his syght thorow Iesus christ To whom be prayse for ever whill the worlde endureth Amen.
058	HEB	013	022	I beseche you brethren suffre the wordes of exhortacio: For we have written vnto you in feawe wordes:
058	HEB	013	023	knowe the brother Timothe whom we have sent fro vs with whom (yf he come shortly) I will se you.
058	HEB	013	024	Salute the that have the oversight of you and all the saynctes.  They of Italy salute you.
058	HEB	013	025	Grace be with you all.  Amen.
