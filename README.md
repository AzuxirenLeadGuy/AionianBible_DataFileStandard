# About

This repository is forked from [Nainoia's Data Files](https://github.com/Nainoia-Inc/AionianBible_DataFileStandard). These files now contain additional metadata of the names of the books in their particular language.

There is also the file BOOKS.txt attached with raw data of the books' name in text format.
